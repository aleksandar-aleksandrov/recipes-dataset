      Title: Hot Chocolate Souffles
 Categories: Dessert, Baking, English
      Servings: 6 servings

      9 oz Semisweet chocolate, chopped
      4 ea Lg Egg yolks
      2 T  Dark rum
      1 T  Unsalted butter, melted
      6 ea Lg Egg whites
      1 pn Cream of tartar

  In the top of a double boiler set over simmering water, melt the
  chocolate, stirring, until it is smooth.  Remove the pan from the

  addition, and whisk in the rum and butter.  Transfer mixture to a
  large bowl.
  In a bowl with an electric mixer, beat the egg whites with the cream
  of tartar and a pinch of salt until they hold stiff peaks.  Stir a
  quarter of the egg whites into the chocolate mixture then fold in the
  remaining egg whites gently but thoroughly.  Spoon the mixture into 6
  buttered 2/3 cup souffle dishes and bake them on a baking sheet in the
  middle of a preheated 400f oven for 10-12 minutes, or until they are
  puffed and a tester comes out nearly clean.

      Title: Yorkshire Oatcakes (from Grigson's ENGLISH FOOD)
 Categories: Breads, English
      Servings: 4 servings

      1 lb Fine oatmeal
    1/2 oz Fresh yeast
      1 t  Salt (scant)
           Water at blood heat

  Put the oatmeal and salt in a bowl.  Cream the yeast with a teacupful
  of water, and leave it to rise to a creamy froth.  Mix into the
  oatmeal and add more water until the batter is like a thick cream.  A
  ladleful is thrown onto the heated griddle or bakestone, in a narrow
  strip.  It immediately puffs up with steam, which makes it smooth
  underneath and rough on top.  "When baked it is damp and flexible,
  and is hung on the wooden clothes rail before the fire" (if you have
  one!) "to dry, or on lines across the kitchen ceiling.  It must be
  crisped quickly immediately before it is to be eaten."  The flavour
  is slightly bitter and very appetising.  "It can be used for soups,
  fish, fowl, cheese, butter, or any kind of meat in place of any other
  kind of bread or biscuit."

  (Lacking lines in the kitchen, you might try hanging the cakes over a
  broomstick handle in front of a radiator or open fire, or just
  toasting them under the broiler.  When we had an Aga, in the kitchen
  of the last house we rented, we used the "towel-drying rail" in front
  of the ovens for this kind of thing, as well as for drying pasta:  it
  worked very well.)

      Title: Toad in the Hole
 Categories: English, Sausages, Meats
      Servings: 4 servings

      4 oz Plain white flour
      2    Small eggs
    1/2 t  Salt
     10 fl Milk
      4    100% pork sausages

  Essentially, this dish is Yorkshire pudding with sausages in it.

  Preheat the oven to 450F. Saute the sausages briefly in a pan to draw
  off excess fat.  Reserve this. Cut the sausages into chunks.

  Put the fat in a small roasting pan (a metal 9X9 cake pan is
  perfect): add a little oil, if necessary, to bring the amount of fat
  up to about 4 tablespoons.  Heat the fat, either in a hot oven or on
  the stove, until smoking hot. Meanwhile, prepare the batter mixture.
  When the pan and fat are *very* hot, pour in the batter mixture,
  scatter the sausage chunks onto it, and put the whole business into
  the hot oven. Bake for about 5-10 minutes at 450F, then reduce to
  400F and bake until the Yorkshire pudding around the sausages has
  puffed up nicely and is a deep golden brown. This may take as long as
  30 minutes or as little as 20:  keep an eye on it. Serve immediately
  when done.  Warning:  the pudding will deflate if kept waiting.

  Variants on this dish can be made with chunks of leftover roast beef,
  or almost any kind of meat, just so that you alter the cooking time
  to take into account whether the meat being used has already been
  cooked adequately when it goes into the pudding.

  Also:  some people like to add a little beer to the pudding mixture.

      Title: Cornish Pasty
 Categories: British, Cornish, Pastry, Meats
      Servings: 4 servings

      1 lb Rump, chuck, or skirt steak
      5 oz Onion, chopped
      3 oz Turnip (swede), chopped
      8 oz Potato, peeled, sliced thin
           Salt, pepper, thyme

  "Make a firm pastry and roll out two dinner-plate circles, or four
  side-plate circles, according to whether you are feeding two ravenous
  people or four of moderate appetite.  Leave to chill, while you
  prepare the filling.

  "Cut all skin and gristle from the meat, and chop it.  There should
  be at least 10 oz of skirt, and rather more of better quality steak.

  "Season and layer the filling ingredients to one side of the pastry
  circles.  Or mix them together (traditions differ).  Brush edges with
  egg:
   flip over the pastry to form a half-moon shape, and twist the edges
  to give a rope effect.  Mark initials on the pastys, if you have
  varied the filling, in one corner.  Brush over with egg and make two
  small holes at the top for steam to escape.  Bake at 400F for 20
  minutes, then lower the heat to 350F for a further 40 minutes.
  Protect the pastry with butter papers or foil if they brown too fast.

  "...The pasty -- pronounced with a long ah as in Amen -- is Cornwall's
  most famous and most travestied dish.  Admittedly in times of
  poverty, its contents might be reduced to potatoes, or to parsley and
  an egg with a leek or two or a hint of bacon, but surely it never
  tasted as awful as the so-called Cornish pasties sold all over the
  country in supermarkets and cheap restaurants.  The pastry obviously
  had to be firm, because pasties were a packed lunch, for carrying to
  the mines, fishing boats or schools (though not so hard that the
  pasty could be dropped down a mineshaft without breaking -- an old
  joke).

  "At home, whatever might be put in a pasty on a working day, might
  come to the table in the form of a double-crust plate pie, or even
  without pastry at all -- steak, topped by turnip and potato, being
  layered into a pot and baked in the oven, a dish known as
  meat'n'under, or under roast.

  "Whatever other people do to it, the Cornish keep their love of
  pasties; and all over the world, where Cornish miners have gone to
  find work, you are likely to find pasties.  In the Upper Peninsula of
  Michigan, for example, other ethnic groups have taken to the pasty,
  and you get Finnish or Italian versions as well as the original
  Cornish kind.   They even keep the Cornish habit of marking initials
  on a corner of the crust, so that a half-eaten pasty can be left on a
  school bench, for example, and reclaimed by its owner after a fight
  or a game.  And so that each individual in a family can have the
  variation of filling that he or she likes best."

      1 c  Heavy cream
    1/2 c  Sherry
      3    Egg yolks; lightly beaten
      6 sl Bread;
      3 oz Butter; 6 Tbsp
      1 ts Cinnamon

  "I have never found out the origin  of this recipe or where its name
  comes from. However, it is particularly pleasant because of the
  contrast between the hot toasted bread (which is similar to the
  French toast) and the cold raspberries and cream."

  Sprinkle the raspberries with confectioner's sugar, crush them gently
  with a fork and set aside. Whip the cream until it is stiff. Place
  the sherry in one bowl and the lightly beaten egg yolks in another.
  Dip the bread slices first in the sherry and then in the egg yolks.
  Melt the butter in a frying pan and when it is hot, fry the bread on
  both sides until it is golden brown. Transfer the slices to a warm
  dish and sprinkle each side with a little cinnamon. Place a few of
  the raspberries on each slice of the toasted bread and cover with a
  dollop of cream. SERVES: 4-6

      Title: Buttered Oranges
 Categories: British, Desserts, Fruit, My
      Servings: 4 servings

      5    Oranges; large, juicy
      4 T  Sugar
      6    Egg yolks
      2 T  Sherry
      1 ts Rosewater; optional
      4 oz Butter; 1/2 cup
      1 c  Heavy cream

  "A recipe for Buttered Oranges can be found in Ann Blendcowe's
  cookery book published in 1694; they are also sometimes referred to
  as Nell Gwynn's Buttered Oranges, as she was believed to have served
  them to Charles II. Buttered Oranges are delicious, and they look
  spectacular."

  To prepare the Orange Shells: Hold the orange so the stalk (or navel)
  is at the base and using a small knife cut off the top about two
  inches down. Scoop out all the flesh, being carefully not to break
  the skin. This can be done quite easily with a teaspoon. Using a pair
  of scissors, cut off the stalk that remains in the bottom, wash the
  orange and set it aside (the top can be discarded). Repeat this
  procedure with three more of the oranges. Grate the peel off the
  remaining orange and then squeeze the juice from this orange into the
  bowl. Place the flesh you have extracted from the other oranges in
  the sieve and squeeze the juice in the same bowl. Mix the juice with
  the sugar and egg yolks in a double boiler over low heat. Beat with a
  wire whisk until the mixture begins to thicken. Remove the top of the
  double boiler and cool in a bowl of cold water while you continue to
  stir; then add the sherry and rosewater. Remove the bowl from the
  cold water. Cut the butter into 1-inch cubes and mash it into the
  mixture piece by piece. Add the orange peel. Whip 3/4 of the cream
  and fold it into the mixture. Pour the mixture into the four orange
  shells and refrigerate for at least 2 hours. Before serving, place
  three crystallized violets on the top of each orange; whip the
  remaining cream and force it through a pastry tube in a curly pattern
  around the top edges. SERVES:4

      Title: STEAK & KIDNEY PIE
 Categories: Beef, British, Main dish
      Servings: 1 servings

      1    Kidney, beef
      4 T  Shortening
      2    Onion; chopped
      2 lb Round steak; cubed
  1 1/2 T  Worcester sauce
    1/2 t  Salt
    1/2 t  Pepper
      2 T  Butter; softened
      2 T  Flour
      2 T  Parsley; minced
      1 t  Rosemary
      1 t  Oregano
      1 c  Flour; + 2 t
    1/4 t  Salt
    1/3 c  Shortening
      2 T  ;water, cold

  Wash the kidney, remove membranes and fat, and cut kidney in 1"
  cubes. Cube the steak into 1" cubes.  Melt the shortening in a heavy
  pot. Add the onions and cook, stirring often, until well browned. Add
  the steak and kidneys.  When the meat is browned on all sides, pour
  on 2 cups of boiling water, Worcester, salt, and pepper.  Cove and
  cook over a very low heat for 1 1/2 hours, or until the steak is
  tender. Preheat the oven to 400 F. Blend the butter with the flour to
  make a beurre manie. Drop small pellets of this paste into the sauce
  and stir to thicken it. Put meat and sauce into a deep pie plate and
  sprinkle with parsley. If you wish to use a pastry topping, roll out
  the dough and cover the pie plate. Slash the top, crimp the edges,
  and bake about 30 minutes, or until well browned. Pastry: Mix the
  flour and salt. Cut in the shortening with a pastry blender. Combine
  lightly only until the mixture resembles coarse meal or very tine
  peas; its texture will not be uniform but will contain crumbs and
  small bits and pieces.  Sprinkle water over the flour mixture, a
  tablespoon at a time, and mix lightly with a fork, using only enough
  water so that the pastry will hold together when pressed gently into
  a ball.

      Title: Clotted Cream
 Categories: Dairy
      Servings: 8 servings

     20 fl Heavy whipping cream
      2 qt Milk (or more)*

  *Preferably extra-rich milk, if you can get it in your area.   --
  Choose a wide-mouthed bowl or stainless steel bowl with sloping
  sides.  Fill it with milk, leaving a deep enough rim free to avoid
  spillage.  Add 20 fl double cream.  Leave in the refrigerator for at
  least several hours, and preferably overnight.  Set the bowl over a
  pan of water kept at 82 degrees C (180 F) and leave until the top of
  the milk is crusted with a nubbly yellowish-cream surface.  This will
  take at least 1 1/2 hours, but it is prudent to allow much longer.
  Take the bowl from the pan and cool it rapidly in a bowl of ice
  water, then store in the refrigerator until very cold.  Take the
  crust off with a skimmer, and put it into another bowl with a certain
  amount of the creamy liquid underneath;  it is surprising how much
  the clotted part firms up -- it needs the liquid.  You can now put
  the milk back over the heat for a second crust to form, and add that
  in its turn to the first one.  The milk left over makes the most
  delicious rice pudding, or can be used in baking, especially of yeast
  buns. .

     Title: English Crumpets (bakestone Recipes)
Categories: Breads, Breakfast
  Servings:  4

      4 oz All-purpose flour
      4 oz Bread flour
      2 t  Salt
    1/4 oz Fresh yeast
      1 t  Sugar
    1/2 pt Warm milk and water
      1 T  Vegetable oil
    1/2 t  Bicarbonate of soda
    1/4 pt Warm water

  Sift the flours and salty into a warm bowl.  Cream the yeast with the
  sugar.  Add the warmed milk and water, then the oil.  Stir into the flour
  to make a batter, and beat vigorously until smooth and elastic.  Cover the
  bowl, put in a warm place and leave it until the mixture rises and the
  surface is full of bubbles (about 1 1/2 hours).  Break it down by beating
  with a wooden spoon.  Cover and leave in a warm place to prove for another
  30 minutes.  -- To cook the crumpets, heat and grease the bakestone
  lightly.  Grease 5 or 6 crumpet rings (3-3 1/2 inches) (or scone cutters)
  and put them on the bakestone to heat.  Cook as many crumpets as possible
  at a time, as the batter will not stay bubbly for long.   -- Put 1/2 inch
  deep of batter into each ring.  Cook gently for 7 - 10 minutes, or until
  the surface sets and is full of tiny bubbles.  Using an oven glove for
  protection, lift off the ring, and if the base of the crumpet is pale
  gold, flip it over and cook for another 3 minutes until the other side is
  just colored.  If the crumpet batter is set but sticks slightly in the
  ring, push it out gently with the back of a wooden spoon.  Wipe, grease
  and heat the rings for each batch of crumpets.  If serving immediately,
  wrap the crumpets in a cloth and keep warm between batches.  Butter
  generously and serve at once.  If reheating, toast the crumpets under the
  grill, cooking the smooth surface first and then the top so that the
  butter will melt into the holes.

Categories: Breads, Breakfast
  Servings:  4

      1 lb All-purpose or bread flour
      1 t  Salt
  1 1/2 T  Dry yeast
      1 t  Sugar
      8 fl Warm milk and water
      2 oz Butter, melted

  (Note:  Over here, and in England, these are just called "muffins", and
  are the ones in the song about the Muffin Man who lives in Drury Lane.
  They did actually sell them door-to-door every morning in London until the
  turn of the century or thereabouts.)
  .
  Sift the flour and salt into a bowl and leave in a warm place.  Dissolve
  the yeast and sugar in 1/4 pt of the warm milk and water.  Leave to froth,
  then mix in the fat.  Stir all the liquid into the warm flour and beat
  well until smooth and elastic.  Cover and prove in a warm place for 50
  minutes or until doubled in bulk.  Turn onto a well-floured board and
  knead, working a little more flour if necessary to make the dough easier
  to shape.  Round up the dough, roll into a thick sausage shape and (using
  the sharpest knife you have) slice into 8 to 10 portions, each about 1 1/2
  ~ 1 3/4 inch thick.  Shape each one into a round with straight sides.  Put
  onto a greased baking sheet.  Cover (I use greased plastic wrap) and put
  in a warm place to prove for 30-40 minutes or until springy to the touch.
  Leave room for expansion and be careful not to over-prove, as the muffins
  will get flabby and lose their shape.   Warm and grease the bakestone
  lightly.  Lift the muffins carefully onto the bakestone and cook over very
  moderate heat for 8-10 minutes until pale gold underneath.  Turn and cook
  the other side.  Wrap in a cloth and keep warm if cooking in batches.  To
  serve, insert a knife in the side, pull the top and bottom slightly apart,
  and insert slivers of butter.
  .
  These are strongly recommended.  The taste of them hot off the bakestone,
  griddle or frying pan makes Thomas's look very poor indeed by comparison.

      1 t  Sugar
      5 fl Warm water
      1 t  Butter
      5 fl Warm milk
      1    Egg, beaten

  *Or 1 1/2 t dried yeast.  -- These are similar to crumpets -- they are
  made with a yeast batter, but cooked without rings.  -- Sift the flour and
  salt into a warm bowl.  Dissolve the yeast and the sugar in the warm
  water.  Melt the butter in the warm milk and beat in the egg.  Stir the
  yeast liquid and then the milk mixture into the flour.  Mix into a smooth
  batter and beat well. Cover and leave in a warm place for 1 to 1 1/2
  hours, until the batter is thick and bubbling.  Warm the bakestone and
  grease with a piece of lard on a fork (use a piece of fat back if you're
  short of lard).  When a drop of water sputters on the bakestone, it's hot
  enough.  Stir the batter, then use a ladle or a jug to pour it onto the
  bakestone in round "puddles|, leaving space in between so that the
  pikelets will be easy to turn.  The yeast batter will not spread as much
  as pancake batter.  Cook over a moderate heat until bubbles break the top
  surface and the underneath is pale gold.  Flip over the pikelets and cook
  the other side until honey-colored.  Keep wach batch warm in a folded
  cloth in a low oven.  Serve with butter, honey or preserves, or for a
  savory dish, with cream cheese or grilled bacon, or little sausages.  To
  reheat, crisp under the grill.

      1 t  Salt
      2 oz Butter, softened
      4 T  Self-raising flour
      1    Butter for filling

  Potato cakes are eaten with bacon and sausages.  It's easier to make them
  with hot, freshly cooked potatoes.  If using cold potatoes, melt the
  butter before adding it.  Choose a floury type of potato, and boil in
  well-salted water. -- Drain the cooked potatoes well, then return to low
  heat in the same pan:  put a dishcloth over the pan and allow the potatoes
  to dry for 5-10 minutes.  (This is called "drying in their steam" in
  Ireland.)  They should be dry and floury at the end of the process.  Sieve
  or rice into a mixing bowl with the salt.  Beat in the butter.  Work in
  sufficient flour to make a soft dough which is easy to handle.  Turn onto
  a floured board and roll or pat out to 3/4 inch thick.  Cut into rounds
  with a 3-inch scone cutter.  Place on the hot greased bakestone and cook
  over a moderate heat until golden brown underneath.  Turn and cook the
  other side.  Remove from the bakestone, split, butter generously, and
  close again.  Keep warm while cooking the next batch.  Serve hot.   (Re
  "self-raising flour":  in Ireland and the UK, this is flour which comes
  with baking powder/baking soda already included.  For this recipe, about
  1/4-1/2 t of baking powder mixed with a plain all-purpose flour will
  substitute nicely.)

  "dry in their steam". Sieve or rice into a warmed mixing bowl, and beat in
  the fat. Work in sufficient flour to make the dough manageable, adding
  salt to taste. Divide the dough in half and roll or pat into 2 rounds of
  equal size just over 1/2 inch thick. Place one round on the warmed
  bakestone and spread with the chopped apple. Cover with the other round of
  dough and pinch the edges together.  -- Bake on the bakestone over a
  moderate heat until brown underneath.  Turn using the broadest spatula you
  have, or two spatulas and a friend.  Cook the other side.  Remove the cake
  to a hot serving dish.  Carefully peel up one side of the top of the cake,
  spread the apples with the softened butter, and sprinkle them with sugar.
  Fold that half down and do the same to the other side.  Sprinkle sugar on
  top, and serve immediately, with thick cool cream.

     Title: Swedish Flatbread (bakestone Recipes)
Categories: Breads, Breakfast
  Servings:  8

      8 oz Ground wholemeal flour
      8 oz Rye or barley flour
      1 t  Salt
      8 fl Lukewarm water*

  *You may need as much as 12 fl total.  -- Blend the flours together with
  the salt.  Mix in sufficient water to bind together into a dough -- the
  quantity will depend on the types of flour used. -- Beat until dough
  leaves the sides of the bowl, then turn onto a floured board and knead
  thoroughly.  Heat the bakestone over a moderate heat and grease it.
  Divide the dough into four and roll one quarter out into a round as thin
  as possible.  Using a plate about 8 inches wide, trim the edges into a
  neat circle.  Prick all over to prevent the dough bubbling while cooking.
  ~- Transfer to the bakestone and cook over a moderate heat for about 15
  minutes, or until slightly colored.  Then turn and cook the other side.
  Repeat with the rest of the dough, working up the trimmings for re-shaping
  and baking.  -- Cool on a wire tray.  When cold, store in an airtight
  container.  (Danish-butter-cookie containers, the big ones, are good for
  this.)

     Title: Drop Scones (bakestone Recipes)
Categories: Breads, Breakfast, Cakes
  Servings:  8

      4 oz Self-raising flour
      2 T  Granulated sugar
      1    Egg, beaten
      5 fl Milk*

  *Approximate.  -- Sift the flour into a mizing bowl and mix in the sugar.
  Make a well in the center of the flour and drop in the egg.  Stir in the
  milk gradually and mix to a creamy batter.  The thicker the batter, the
  thicker the pancake will be.  Heat the bakestone and grease lightly.
  Using a large spoon, drop the batter off it in round "puddles" onto the
  bakestone, leaving room for spreading.  Cook over a moderate heat until
  the top surface is covered with bubbles, and when the underside is golden,
  turn and cook the other side.  When golden, lift off the bakestone and
  wrap in a cloth.  Serve as soon as possible with butter, honey and
  preserves.  If any are left until the next day, they can be crisped under
  the grill before serving.  For a change, 1 oz of butter can be rubbed into
  the flour and sugar:  or lemon essence (six drops) can be added to the
  batter.

     Title: Honey And Cream Scones (bakestone Recipes)
Categories: Breads, Breakfast, Cakes
  Servings:  8

      6 oz Whole wheat flour
      6 oz Plain flour
      2 t  Bicarbonate of soda
      1 t  Cream of tartar
      1 oz Butter
      5 fl Sour cream
      4 oz Clear honey
      1    Egg

  and honey together until the honey is dissolved. Beat in the egg. Make a
  well in the flour, pour in the liquid and mix to a soft dough. Turn onto a
  floured board and knead in a little extra flour if necessary. Roll out 1/2
  inch thick and cut into rounds with a 2-inch cutter. Lift onto a heated
  and greased bakestone and brush the tops of the scones with a little milk.
   Cook until the underside is golden, then turn and cook the other side.
  Serve hot, split and spread with butter and honey:  or serve cold with
  butter or clotted cream.

     Title: Oatcakes (bakestone Recipes)
Categories: Breads, Breakfast
  Servings:  8

      4 oz Medium oatmeal*
    1/2 t  Salt
      1 pn Bicarbonate of soda
      2 T  Melted bacon fat**
      2 fl Hot water***

  *Grinding down regular rolled oats slightly in a blender or grinder will
  be a help.  **Or beef dripping.  ***Approximately.  -- Mix the oatmeal,
  salt and soda in a bowl.  Make a well in the center.  Pour in the melted
  fat and add enough water to make a stiff dough which can be squeezed into
  a ball.  Sprinkle the board and your hands with oatmeal and knead the
  mixture until there are no cracks in it.  Flatten the ball and roll it out
  into a round just under 1/4 inch thick.  Invert a plate on top and trim
  off the ragged edges -- these can be added to the next batch of dough to
  be rolled.  Cut the round into quarters, lift them onto a warmed and
  greased bakestone and cook over moderate heat for 20 minutes or until the
  triangles curl at the corners.  Turn and cook the other side for 5
  minutes, or finish under a moderate grill.  Store the oatcakes in an
  airtight tin, and toast under a moderate grill, or in the oven, before
  serving.  -- These are served with honey, marmalade or jam for breakfast,
  or with crowdie (a slightly sweet Highland Scots cottage cheese) for tea.
  They are especially good with fried herring or smoked haddock.  Not to
  mention any kind of caviar you can get your hands on.

      Title: Kourambiedes
 Categories: Cookies, Greek
   Servings: 50

      1 c  Sweet butter
    1/2 c  Powdered sugar
      1    Egg yolk
      2 tb Brandy or Cognac, (optional)
      1 ts Almond extract
      1 ts Vanilla extract
      1 ts Baking powder
  2 1/4 c  Sifted cake flour; (or more)
    3/4 c  Ground almonds; toasted
      1 lb Powdered sugar; sifted

  In electric mixing bowl, whip the sweet butter until it is fluffy and
  white.  Continuing to beat on medium speed, gradually add the 1/2 cup
  powdered sugar, egg yolk, and flavorings.
      Meanwhile, sift the baking powder with the flour and gradually add to
  the batter, mixing by hand and working the flour thoroughly into the
  mixture before adding more.  Mix in ground almonds.  Knead until a soft,
  buttery dough is formed that will stay together when a little is rolled in
  the palms of your hands.  Break off pieces slightly larger than a walnut,
  then roll into balls, half-moons, or S-curves.  Place on cookie sheets
  allowing an inch between each.  Bake on the center rack of a 350-degree
  oven for 12 to 15 minutes or until golden colored, not chestnut.  Remove
  from the oven and carefully lift each Kourambie and place on a generous
  layer of sifted powdered sugar.  Immediately sift more powdered sugar over
  to cover Kourambiedes.  Allow to cool for 10 to 15 minutes before lifting
  and rolling to be sure they are evenly coated.  May be served in
  individual fluted paper cups.

      Title: Spanakopitas
 Categories: Appetizers, Greek
   Servings: 60

      2 tb Butter or oil
      1 lb Frozen spinach; thawed
      3    Green onions; sliced
      3 tb Minced parsley
      2 tb Chopped fresh dill
    1/2 lb Feta cheese; crumbled
      3    Eggs; lightly beaten
           Salt & Pepper to taste
      1 lb Commercial Filo pastry
    1/2 lb Melted butter

  In butter or oil, saute green onion until soft. Meanwhile, squeeze out
  excess moisture from spinach and chop by hand or in food processor.
  Combine green onion with spinach and remaining filling ingredients in
  bowl. Mix well and set aside.

  Lay out the Filo sheets, covering them with waxed paper and a damp towel.
  Take out two sheets at a time and keep the rest covered. Brush melted
  butter onto top sheet of each pair. Cut each double-sheet crosswise into
  equal strips, about 2-1/2" wide. Place 1 teaspoon of the filling 1" from
  the end (nearest you) of each strip. Fold the strips back over the filling
  so the bottom edge meets the left edge, forming a right angle. Continue
  folding back at right angles to make a triangular shape. Place on baking
  sheets and keep covered until all are ready to bake. Bake in a 350 degree
  oven for 20 to 25 minutes or until golden and crisp, turning once. NOTE-
  Spanakopitas may be frozen before baking. When ready to bake, separate
  while still frozen, spead on baking sheets, and bake as above, allowing an
  extra 10 minutes baking time.

      Title: Baklava
 Categories: Desserts, Greek
   Servings: 60

  3 1/2 c  Granulated sugar
  2 1/2 c  Water
      2 tb Honey
      1    Lemon rind
      1    Stick cinnamon
      4    Whole cloves
  1 1/4 lb Walnuts & blanched almonds
           - Chopped medium fine
      2 ts Ground cinnamon
      1 ts Ground cloves
  1 1/2 lb Commercial filo sheets
      1 lb Sweet butter; melted

  Combine 3 cups sugar, the water, honey, whole lemon rind, and whole spices
  in a saucepan and bring to boil.  Lower the heat and simmer for 15
  minutes, then remove the lemon peel and spices and cool.

  Meanwhile, in a large bowl, combine the nuts, remaining 1/2 cup sugar, and
  ground spices and set aside.  Lay filo sheets flat, cover with waxed paper
  and then a damp towel.  Keep covered except when removing to assemble the
  baklava.  Count 8 filo sheets, fold, cover and refrigerate to reserve for
  the top.  Using a large pastry brush, butter an 11 1/2-inch by 15 1/2-inch
  by 3-inch baking pan.  Lay a filo sheet on the bottom of the pan, brush
  with warm butter, and repeat using 8 sheets.  Scoop up a handful of the
  nut-spice mixture and sprinkle over the top filo sheet inside the pan.
  Lay on 3 or more filo sheets, brushing each with butter, and sprinkle
  again with the nut mixture.  Continue until all the nuts and filo are
  used.  (The important things here are to butter each filo and spread the
  nuts evenly.  The way to do the latter is to rotate the pan several times
  during the procedure.)  Now you can remove the reserved sheets from the
  refrigerator and spread over the top, brushing on each sheet.

  Using a long, very sharp knife, score the baklava from top to bottom into
  diamond shapes planning in advance the size desired.  Be sure the knife
  touches the bottom of the pan as you cut.  Heat the remaining butter to
  sizzling and pour over the top.  Bake in a 300 degree oven for 1 1/4 hours
  or until golden chestnut in color and flaky.  Remove from the oven (in the
  pan) to a rack, and spoon the cooled syrup over the entire pastry. Cool in
  the pan, then serve each piece individually.

      Title: Bougatsa
 Categories: Desserts, Greek
   Servings:  8

    1/2 lb Cream cheese
      1 lb Fresh ricotta cheese
      1 lb Fresh lg-curd cottage cheese
           Granulated sugar
    1/2 ts Grated nutmeg
     18    Sheets commercial filo
    1/2 c  Butter (or more); melted

  Using an electric mixer, beat the cream cheese at high speed until light
  and fluffy.  Lower the speed and add the ricotta, cottage cheese, 1 1/2
  tablespoons sugar, and the nutmeg.  Beat for 1 minute at high speed, then
  set aside while you prepare the filo.
      Lay the filo flat on a table and keep covered with a damp towel over
  waxed paper or plastic wrap.  By stacking 4 sheets, form a base of 15 x 18
  inches, brushing the top of each sheet with melted butter as you stack
  them.  Then lay 2 sheets at right angles over the center, using the "base"
  as a diamond, not a square, brushing the center of each with butter.
  Divide the filling into 3 parts and spread one part over the filo to form
  a 7-inch square.  Set the rest of the filling aside.  Fold the top filo
  sheet over the cheese and brush with butter, and continue folding the filo
  over the cheese to make a square, brushing each time with butter.  With a
  wide spatula, lift the bougatsa and invert onto a cookie sheet.  Brush the
  top with butter and set aside.
      Repeat with the remaining filo, filling until all 3 square pies are
  folded.  Bake in a 350 degree oven for 15 to 20 minutes or until the filo
  puffs up and turns a golden chestnut color.  Cut into small squares and
  sprinkle with additional sugar.  Serve piping hot.

  Fold side edges over 1/2" so filling won't fall out.  Continue rolling.
      Place in a buttered baking pan or cookie sheet.  Brush tops generously
  with melted butter.  Bake at 350 degrees for 1 hour.  Sift powdered sugar
  over tops and sides as soon as it is taken out of the oven and while still
  hot.  When cool, cut into 2" pieces and serve.

      Title: Greek Tsoureki (Easter Bread)
 Categories: Greek, Breads, Holiday
   Servings:  2

      1 c  Milk
    1/2 c  Sweet butter
      1 pk Active dry yeast
    1/2 c  Granulated sugar
      1 ts Salt
      2    Eggs; beaten
      5 tb Orange juice
      1 tb Grated orange rind
  5 1/2 c  Sifted flour
           Butter; melted
           Red-dyed, hard-boiled eggs
    1/4 c  Slivered almonds
      2 tb Granulated sugar

  In a small saucepan, combine the milk and butter over medium heat and
  scald.  Stir until the butter melts, then pour into a mixing bowl.  When
  lukewarm, sprinkle in the yeast, and with fingers or a heavy spoon
  gradually stir in the 1/2 cup sugar until it dissolves.  Then add the
  salt, eggs 3 tablespoons of the orange juice, and the orange rind,
  stirring continuously, and gradually add half the flour until the mixture
  begins to bubble.  Continue adding flour gradually by hand; the dough will
  be sticky, but should not be stiff.  Flour your fingers lightly and knead
  for 15 minutes.  Place the dough in a large buttered bowl, brush the dough
  with melted butter, cover, and place in a warm area to rise until doubled
  in bulk (approximately 2 to 3 hours).
     Punch the dough down and divide into 2 parts.  Divide each half into 3
  parts and roll each into a long rope about 10" x 2".  Braid the three
  ropes together; pinch to seal the ends if leaving long, or join together
  to form a long round loaf (see note below).  Repeat with the other half of
  the dough to make a second tsoureki.  Place in large baking pans or on a
  cookie sheet, cover, and let rise until doubled in bulk (approx. 1 1/2
  hours).
     Meanwhile, prepare the glaze by mixing the remaining orange juice,
  remaining sugar, and the almonds in a small bowl.  Bake the tsourekia in a
  375 degree oven for 20 minutes.  Remove from the oven and with a pastry
  brush glaze the tops and sides of loaves.  Return to the oven and bake for
  another 15 to 20 minutes until the color is a rich and shiny chestnut.
     Note:  If using the Easter eggs, tuck them into the center when you
  shape the loaves, leave until loaves have doubled and bake them with the
  loaf.  After baking, though lovely, the eggs will be inedible.  Also in
  some provinces, the tsoureki is formed with a large braid and a smaller
  one over it, making a much larger loaf requiring a longer baking time.

      Title: Pastitsio
 Categories: Main dish, Casseroles, Greek
   Servings: 24

  1 1/2 lb Ziti thick, uncut macaroni
           Salt
      2 c  Grated cheeses*
      6 tb Melted butter
      7    Eggs
      6 c  Saltsa Kima
      6 c  Medium Saltsa Aspri
      1 ts Ground cinnamon
    1/2 ts Grated nutmeg
      1 c  Bread crumbs

  *Note: Grated cheeses can be any combination of mizithra, kefalotyri (hard
  ricotta) or Romano cheeses.
  In a large pot, boil the ziti in salted water until almost tender.  Drain
  thoroughly.  In a large bowl, combine the macaroni, 1 1/2 cups of the
  grated cheeses, the butter, and 4 of the eggs, lightly beaten.
      Butter an 11" x 15" x 3" baking pan, and in it layer half the macaroni
  mixture.  Separate 2 of the eggs and combine the 2 egg whites plus 1 more
  whole egg with the Saltsa Kima.  Spread it evenly over the macaroni in the
  pan and cover with the remaining macaroni.  Meanwhile, combine the Saltsa
  Aspri with the 2 egg yolks and the spices.  Pour over the macaroni,
  spreading it into the corners with a spatula.  Sprinkle the top lightly
  with the remaining cheese and the bread crumbs.  Bake in a 350 degree for
  45 minutes or until a golden crust develops and the sauce bubbles.  Remove
  from the oven and allow to stand for 15 minutes before cutting into
  squares.  Serve on a warm platter.
  Note:  Try this once using 1 1/2 pounds of ziti for an elegant pastitsio.
  A very rich recipe; you can safely reduce the meat sauce and Saltsa Aspri
  by one cup, if desired.

  To make the sauce, in a heavy saucepan melt the butter and heat WITHOUT
  browning.  Using a wire whisk, stir in the flour.  Cook for 1 to 2 minutes
  over low heat, then remove from the burner and gradually stir in the warm
  milk.  Move the pan back to the heat and bring to a boil, stirring
  steadily for a smooth sauce.  Add a pinch of salt and white pepper, and
  grate a little nutmeg for a nice flavor.
      As a general rule, thin white sauce is used for soups and sauces,
  medium for pastitsio and moussaka and other au gratin dishes, and a thick
  sauce for croquettes and souffles.

      Title: Taramosalata
 Categories: Greek, Appetizers
   Servings:  8

      3 sl French/Italian bread; -OR-
      2 md -Potatoes, boiled & peeled
      5 oz Tarama (fish roe)
      1 c  Olive oil
      1    Lemon's juice (or more)
      2 tb Vinegar
      1 tb Water (more if necessary)
    1/2    Onion, (optional); grated

  Soak the tarama in warm water a few minutes, then rinse and drain. If
  using bread slices, discard crusts, soak bread in water, then squeeze dry.
  Using an electric blender or electric mixer (or old-fashioned mortar and
  pestle), thoroughly blend the bread or potatoes and the tarama. Add the
  olive oil as slowly as possible, blending at medium speed, plus a little
  water if the mixture forms peaks. Add the grated onion, if desired, then
  whip at high speed for a few minutes.

  Note: The flavor may be mitigated to suit taste by adding more bread or
  potato; a too-salty taste may be adjusted by dropping in a few tablespoons
  of sour cream while blending. Leftover taramasalata can be stored in a
  covered jar in the refrigerator for 7 to 10 days.

  adding the tomatoes, a little salt and pepper, 2 to 3 cloves garlic,
  crushed, and the herbs.  Continuing to beat, gradually add the olive oil
  alternately with the red wine vinegar.  Taste, adding oil and vinegar if

      Title: Stuffed Cabbage With Rice & Pine Nuts Avgolemono
 Categories: Greek, Main dish, Vegetarian
   Servings:  6

      2 md Cabbage heads
      3 tb Clarified butter
      1 md Onion; chopped fine
      1 c  Water
      1 c  Raw long grain rice
    1/4 c  Raisins or currants
    1/2 c  Pine nuts
    1/4 c  Chopped fresh parsley
    1/4 c  Chopped fresh dill
           Salt & freshly ground pepper
      3    Eggs
      1    Lemon, juice only
      2 tb Butter; cut into bits

  Plunge cabbages into boiling salted water and cook about 8 minutes, then
  drain thoroughly and set aside while you prepare the filling. In a heavy
  skillet heat the clarified butter, add the chopped onions and cook until
  soft and transparent.  Add the water and bring to a boil, then add the
  rice and stir.  Lower the heat and simmer gently until the rice has
  absorbed the liquid, approximately 15 minutes.  Remove from heat and add
  the raisins or currants, pine nuts, parsley, dill and season with salt and
  pepper.  Cool.  Separate 2 of the eggs and mix the egg whites into
  filling.  Reserve the yolks for the avgolemono.  Stuff and roll the
  cabbage leaves, using one heaping tablespoon filling, roll up snugly, then
  place, seam side down, in a casserole.  Dot with butter and add water to
  cover, then cover cabbage rolls with an inverted plate and cover
  casserole.  Simmer for approximately 1 hour, then transfer to a warm
  serving dish and keep warm.  Strain the remaining liquid for the
  avgolemono sauce.  Beat the remaining eggs and yolks for 2 minutes.
  Continuing to beat, gradually add the lemon juice.  Then add the 1-1/2
  cups cooking liquid by droplets, beating steadily, until all has been
  added.  Cook over hot water, not boiling, stirring constantly until the
  sauce thickens enough to coat a spoon.  Pour over the cabbage rolls and
  serve hot.  From: "The Food of Greece" by Vilma Liacouras Chantiles,

      Title: Gyros
 Categories: Greek
   Servings:  6

      2 lb Lean lamb, ground
      2 sl Bread; toasted, crushed
      1 ts Allspice; pounded
      1 ts Coriander; crushed
      1    Garlic clove; crushed
      1    Onion; grated
      1 ts Chopped fresh savory

      3 sl Bacon
      6    Pita bread pockets
      2    Tomatoes; sliced thin
           Vinegar & oil to taste
      1 c  Chopped fresh parsley
      1 c  Plain yogurt

  In a large bowl, combine the ground lamb with the bread, allspice,
  coriander, garlic, onion, savory, and salt and pepper, and knead
  thoroughly.  The mixture should be spicy, though not too herby, and hold
  its shape.  Break into 5 sections, each as large as a navel orange, then
  break each section into 6 balls.  Knead and flatten slightly to a
  thickness of about 3/4".  Cut the bacon slices into widths equal to these
  balls, keeping the slices of bacon between them.  Slip a cane skewer
  through the centers and roll gently with the palms to smooth the edges.
  (There will be 5 or 6 skewers, depending on their length.)  Cover and
  refrigerate overnight.  When ready to cook, set on a broiler tray or grill
  and cook under moderate heat, turning every 5 minutes.  (The bacon will
  baste the meat.)  The surface will be crusty and the inside cooked within
  25 minutes.  To serve:  Put out the bread, meat, tomatoes seasoned with
  the vinegar and oil, parsley and yogurt in separate dishes.  Guests may
  open pocket bread and stuff them with meat and seasonings.

      1    Pumpkin (4 to 4 1/2 lbs.)
    1/2 c  Granulated sugar
      2 tb Ground cinnamon
      1 c  Chopped walnuts
      1 lb Commercial phyllo sheets
    1/2 c  Olive oil or butter; melted

  Cut the pumpkin in half, remove and discard the seeds, the peel using a

      Title: Zucchini Blossoms, Cretan Style
 Categories: Greek, Appetizers, Vegetables
   Servings:  6

     30    Zucchini blossoms
      3 tb Olive oil
      4    Scallions, minced
      1    Garlic clove; minced
    1/3 c  Raw long grain rice
    1/2 c  Canned tomatoes; drained
      3 tb Chopped parsley
      3 tb Chopped fresh mint or dill
           Salt & freshly ground pepper
    1/2 ts Granulated sugar

  Soak the stems in cold water overnight, without soaking the blossoms.  The
  following day, wash and drain on a towel.  Cut off and discard the stems
  without breaking the blossoms, and set the blossoms aside while you make
  the filling.  Heat the oil and saute' the scallions until soft.  Add the
  garlic and rice and cook over moderate heat for 2 minutes stirring
  constantly with a wooden spoon.  Stir in the tomatoes, herbs, and enough
  water to cover the rice, then season with salt and pepper and the sugar.
  Simmer for 5 minutes, and remove from the heat.  Using a teaspoon, stuff
  each blossom carefully, holding it in the palm of one hand, then close it
  and lay it on its side in a buttered flameproof casserole large enough to
  accomodate all the blossoms.  Continue until all are filled.  Pour 1 cup
  of warm water into the casserole.  Invert a plate over the flowers, then
  cover the casserole and simmer over lowest heat about 1-1/2 hours.  Check
  every 30 minutes to see if more water is needed; if so, add warm water (it
  should all be absorbed when cooked).  Serve with poultry, meat or fish
  dishes, or as a delightful first course.  From: "The Food of Greece" by

           Green peppers (opt); cubed
           Salt
           Oregano and lemon quarters

  *Note: Lamb meat(s) should be cut into cubes the size of walnuts.
  Place the lamb, sweetbreads, and kidney cubes in a large non-aluminum
  bowl.  Make a marinade of the oil, lemon juice, wine, herbs, garlic, and
  pepper and pour over the meat.  Marinate in the refrigerator, preferably
  overnight, or for at least 3 hours.  Thread the meat on long skewers
  alternating the bay leaves with the tomatoes and peppers, if desired.
  Grill over hot coals or broil 6 inches from the heat, brushing with the
  remaining marinade and turning frequently.  Season with salt and pepper,
  then remove the meat from the skewers to a warm platter and crush oregano
  over the top.  Garnish with lemon quarters and serve hot.

      Title: Grape Nut Roll (Soutzouki)
 Categories: Candies, Greek
   Servings:  1

      6 oz Frozen grape juice;undiluted
    1/2 c  Sugar or honey
      1 sm Box pectin jell
           Citric acid (pea-sized);*OR*
      1    -Lemon, juice only, instead
    1/2 c  Whole walnuts
      3 tb Cornstarch
    1/4 c  Cold water

  Candied nuts and grape juice, "soutzouki", is an ancient candy recipe
  still being used in the villages of Greece.  The traditional recipe is
  quite involved, calling for the stringing of walnuts like beads on linen
  thread, boiling many pounds of grapes into a thick syrup and coating the
  nuts by pouring the thick syrup over them just as if you were making
  candies until a purple necklace is formed.  You can make this recipe in a
  simpler way without having to stamp on the grapes with bare feet.

      In a large deep pot bring juice and honey or sugar to a vigorous boil.
  Add pectin and boil 5 minutes.  Dissolve citric acid first in a tablespoon
  of hot syrup, then add to the rest of the syrup, mixing it in.  Add nuts.
  Dissolve cornstarch in cold water and mix into syrup, stirring quickly.
  Cook 1 minutes more.
      Ladle thick mixture on to heavy waxed paper.  Make a long thick roll.
  Pick up two sides of paper and press together to make a fat sausage of
  candy.  Let set at room temperature.  Store in plastic bag.  Slice as
  needed.

     40    Whole walnuts
     12 oz Frozen grape juice;undiluted
     10 ts Cornstarch
           Confectioners' sugar

  Thread a needle with 2 foot length of white, heavy-duty carpet thread. Tie
  a knot 8 inches from the end. Carefully string 20 walnuts. Tie a knot
  after the last walnut. Tie thread ends together forming a necklace. Repeat
  for remaining 20 walnuts. Divide the grape juice concentrate. From one
  half, pour 1/3 cup into a jar. Pour the remaining amount of that half into
  a small saucepan. Heat to boiling. Spinkle 5 teaspoons of cornstarch into
  the jar of juice. Shake vigorously. Gradually stir into boiling juice.
  Cook until thick enough to heavily coat spoon. Remove from heat. Dip one
  "necklace" into grape juice until every nut is coated. Hang loop in an
  airy spot. Dip and hang second necklace. Allow to hang 30 minutes. Repeat
  the whole procedure. Dry necklaces several days until coating is no longer
  sticky. When dry, repeat dipping. Use the remaining half of grape juice
  and cornstarch.  Dip necklaces twice.  Let hang to dry a week.  When dry,
  snip knotted thread.  Carefully pull out.  Dust rolls with confectioners'
  sugar.  Slice into 1/2 inch rounds.  Makes two 7-inch rolls.

 Categories: Greek, Cakes, Desserts
   Servings: 30

    3/4 c  Butter
    1/4 c  Sugar
      1    Orange (grated rind only)
      2    Egg yolks
  2 1/2 c  Flour
      1 pn Salt
      6    Eggs; separated
    1/2 c  Caster sugar
    1/4 ts Almond essence
    1/4 c  Plain flour
    1/2 ts Baking powder
      2 c  Ground almonds
      1 pn Salt
      8    Fillo pastry sheets
    1/4 c  Unsalted butter; melted
      2 c  Granulated sugar
      1 c  Water
      1    Thin strip orange rind
      1    Thin strip lemon rind
      2 ts Lemon juice
      2    Pieces cinnamon bark

  Cream butter and sugar with grated orange rind until light and fluffy;
  beat in egg yolks.  Sift flour and salt into butter mixture to form a soft
  dough.

  Lightly grease a round 20 cm (12 inch) dish (a "tapsi") or a 25 x 30 cm
  (10 x 12 inch) baking dish.  As pastry moulds easily any tears can be
  pressed together.  An alternative is to put pastry in dish without
  rolling, and press it over base and sides with fingers.  Even out by
  rolling with a straight-sided glass.

  Bake in a moderately hot oven for 15-20 minutes until lightly coloured.
  Remove and cool.

  To make almond filling, beat egg yolks, sugar and almond essence until
  thick and light.  Sift flour with baking powder and combine with ground
  almonds.  Fold this lightly into beaten egg yolks. Beat egg whites with
  salt until stiff but not dry and fold lightly into almond mixture.  Pour
  into pastry-lined dish.

  On a flat surface butter a fillo pastry sheet, top with another and
  butter.  Continue until all sheets are used.  Leave a top sheet
  unbuttered.  Lift onto top of almond filling and trim edges of fillo in
  line with pastry crust, using kitchen scissors.  Brush top with remaining
  butter.  With a sharp knife or razor blade make slits through the top 2 or
  3 sheets running the length of the dish and spacing them 4 cm (1 1/2
  inches) apart.

  Bake in a moderate oven for 45 minutes until top is golden and filling is
  set.  Meanwhile dissolve sugar in water over medium heat, add fruit rinds,
  lemon juice and cinnamon bark and bring to the boil.  Boil for 10 minutes,
  strain and cool.  When torte is cooked, cut through slits in pastry down
  to the bottom crust.  Pour cooled syrup over hot torte, leave until cool.
  Cut diagonally to give diamond-shaped pieces for serving.

  small].)  If making the individual "little canes," they should be half a
  (dainty) finger wide and a finger in length.  The secret of the crispness
  is in adding only enough flour to make a soft dough.

  To make about 100 1-inch squares:

  The mixing of the dough may be begun with an electric mixer, but should be
  finished by hand.  Beat the butter until fluffy, then lower the speed and
  add the olive oil.  Continue beating, and when fluffy beat in the milk,
  baking powder, salt, if necessary, and cheese.  Begin adding flour, but
  after 1 cup stop beating with the mixer and beat in the remaining flour by
  hand, adding only enough to make dough soft enough to roll into strips.
  Knead a few minutes.  Spread or roll on buttered sheet (jelly roll tray,
  cookie sheet, or any flat pan) to a thickness of half-finger's width and
  cut into squares of desired size (the smaller the better, since they are
  rich).  Bake in a moderate oven (350 degrees) for 20 to 25 minutes,
  moving to the top shelf for the last minutes to achieve a golden chestnut
  color.  (If making the "little canes," the baking time will be 10 to 12
  minutes.)  Remove when done and cook on a rack.

  Note: Stored in covered tins, these will keep for several weeks.

      Title: Kreatopitakia (Baked Savory Pastries W/ Seasoned Meat)
 Categories: Greek, Appetizers, Meats
   Servings: 60

      3 tb Butter or margarine
      2    Shallots or onions; minced
      1 lb Lean ground lamb or beef
    1/2 c  Dry white wine
      3    Sprigs fresh parsley;chopped
      1 tb Chopped fresh mint or dill
    1/2 c  Tomato sauce
           Salt & freshly ground pepper
    1/2 c  Grated cheese*
      1    Egg; lightly beaten
      1 tb Bread crumbs; if necessary
      1 lb Commercial filo sheets
      1 c  Butter; melted

  *Note: Suggested cheeses for this recipe are Greek kefalotyri or Parmesan.

  Heat the 3 tablespoons butter or margarine and cook the shallots until
  soft, then add the meat and mash with a fork over medium heat until the
  color changes.  Add the wine and simmer a few minutes.  Stir in the herbs
  and tomato sauce; season with salt and pepper to taste and simmer for 20
  minutes.  Cool.  Add the cheese and egg, and if the mixture is very
  liquid, stir in the bread crumbs immediately before stuffing.

  Filo sheets should be unrolled flat, and cut into thirds (3 x 11 inches).
  Pile up the filo, covering it with waxed paper and a damp towel.  Take out
  one sheet at a time and keep the rest covered.  Butter the filo, one sheet
  at a time, using a pastry brush and the 1 cup melted butter.  Place 1
  teaspoon of the meat filling 1 inch from the end nearest you.  Fold the
  filo back over the filling so the bottom edge meets the left edge, forming
  a right angle. Continue folding back at right angles to make the
  triangular shape.  Place on baking sheets and keep covered until all are
  ready to bake.  Bake in a moderate oven (350 degrees) for 20 to 25 minutes
  or until golden and crisp, turning once.  Serve hot.

      Title: Dolmades Yialandzi (Stuffed Grapevine Leaves)
 Categories: Greek, Appetizers, Vegetarian
   Servings: 60

    3/4 c  Olive oil
    1/2 sm Onion; chopped
      8    Scallions; chopped fine
      2 lg Garlic cloves; chopped
      1 c  Raw long-grain rice
      1 bn Fresh dill; chopped
    1/2 bn Fresh parsley; chopped
  1 1/2    Lemons (or more), juice only
           Salt & freshly ground pepper
      1 c  Hot water
      1 lb Jar grapevine leaves

  Heat the 1/2 cup oil in a skillet.  Add the onion and scallions and saute
  for about 5 minutes, until soft and transparent.  Add the garlic and cook
  for a few minutes, then add the rice, dill, parsley, lemon juice, salt,
  pepper, and remaining 1/4 cup olive oil.  Stir well, then add the hot
  water.  Cover and simmer about 5 minutes.  Remove from the heat and cool.

  Meanwhile, carefully remove the grapevine leaves from the jar, leaving the
  brine in the jar.  Wash grapevine leaves thoroughly and drain, then with a
  sharp knife cut the heavy stems from the leaves.  (If using fresh
  grapevine leaves use the same procedure, parboiling leaves for 5 minutes
  when not tender, then drain.)  Line an enameled pan with a few heavy
  grapevine leaves and set aside.  To stuff a grapevine leaf, put it on your
  working surface rough side up and stem end near you, and place a
  teaspoonful of the rice mixture near the stem end.  Using both hands, fold
  the part of the leaf near you up and over the filling.  Then fold the
  right side of the leaf over the filling, then the left side, and roll
  tightly and back away from you and toward the pointed end of leaf.  Place
  the "dolma", seam side down, in the prepared pan.   Continue stuffing
  grapevine leaves until the mixture has been used.  (If any grapevine
  leaves remain, replace in the reserved brine for future use.)  Place an
  inverted plate on the dolmades, then add enough water to cover the
  dolmades (about 1 to 1-1/2 cups).  Bring to a boil, then cover the pan,
  lower the heat, and simmer as slowly as possible for 1-1/4 hours, then
  taste one to see if the rice is tender, and continue cooking slowly if
  necessary.  Cool, then chill.  Serve cold, as an appetizer or as an
  entree.

  Note:  An important variation, particularly in Macedonia and Thrace: add a
  few tablespoons of raisins and pine nuts to the filling when adding the
  rice.  Also, you may vary the size of dolmades as you wish by adding 1-1/2
  teaspoons of the filling.  However, be consistent to allow them to cook at
  the same rate.  They may be stored in the refrigerator for a week or so.

    1/4 c  Olive oil
      2    Garlic cloves
    1/2 ts Ground coriander (optional)
    1/2 ts Ground cumin (optional)
           Salt & freshly ground pepper
           Chopped fresh parsley

  Wash the chick-peas, then soak overnight with the baking soda in cold
  water to cover.  The following day, drain and wash the chick-peas, then
  cover with fresh water.  Bring to a boil, then lower the heat and simmer
  until tender, 1-1/2 to 2 hours.  Drain and push through sieve or food
  mill, discarding the coarse fibers remaining in the sieve.

  Meanwhile, put the tahini in a small bowl and beat it with the 1/3 cup
  water until dissolved, using a whisk or fork.  Beating briskly with the
  whisk, add the tahini mixture, a teaspoonful at a time, to the chick-peas,
  alternating with the lemon juice and olive oil.  When all has been added,
  crush the garlic over the mixture and sprinkle with optional spices, salt,
  pepper, and 1 tablespoon chopped parsley.  Beat for another minute, then
  taste for seasonings and chill overnight - if possible.  Serve cold,
  sprinkled with additional chopped parsley.  Makes about 2 cups.

      1 lb Ground beef, veal or lamb
      1    Onion; grated
      2    Garlic cloves; crushed (opt)
      6 tb Raw long-grain white rice
           Chopped fresh parsley
      2 tb Chopped dill, mint or basil
      1 ts Dried oregano or thyme
           Salt & freshly ground pepper
      3    Eggs
      5 c  Water or stock
      1    Onion (optional); chopped
      1    Celery stalk (opt.); chopped
    1/2    Carrot (optional); chopped
      1    Lemon (or more), juice only

  In a large bowl, combine the meat, grated onion, garlic, rice, 3
  tablespoons chopped parsley, the mint, oregano, salt and pepper, and 1
  egg, slightly beaten. Knead for a few minutes, then shape into walnut-
  sized barrels and set aside.

  In a soup pot, bring the water or stock to boil with the chopped onion,
  celery and carrot, and salt and pepper to taste. Lower the heat and add
  the meat-rice barrels. Simmer, covered, for 30 minutes, then remove from

  garnished with parsley.

  Note: This soup is frequently made without the additional vegetables added
  to the liquid.  Also, you may enjoy this soup without avgolemono, in which
  case add 1/2 cup canned tomato sauce to the liquid and reduce the water to
  4 1/2 cups.

      Title: Mageritsa (Easter Lamb Soup)
 Categories: Greek, Soups
   Servings:  8

           Intestines, heart, lungs,
           & liver of 1 lamb.
           1 lamb's feet and tripe, opt
      1    Lamb's head (optional)
           Salt
      2    Lemons (juice only)
      1 sm Bunch scallions; chopped
    2/3 c  Chopped fresh parsley
    1/2 c  Chopped fresh dill
    1/4 c  Chopped celery leaves
      6 tb Raw long-grain white rice
    1/2 ts Aniseed (optional)
           Freshly ground pepper
      3    Whole eggs

  Note: If using the lamb's head, wash it, then soak it in cold water for 3
  hours. Drain. Cut the head in half, using a sharp knife, and tie with a
  clean string.

  If using the lamb's feet and tripe, prepare as follows: If tripe is not
  parially cooked, cut open with a sharp knife and clean the inside
  thoroughly under running water. Put in a pan with cold salted water to
  cover and soak for 30 minutes, then drain and wash with cold water. Cut
  into small pieces and put in a large soup pot with the lamb's feet. cover
  with cold water, and simmer until tender, adding salt to taste during the
  last minutes of cooking. Cube the tripe, remove the meat of the feet from
  the bones, and add to the mageritsa at the same time as the cut-up
  intestines, adjusting the liquid by adding more water.

  Clean the intestines thoroughly by turning them inside out, using a long
  skewer or stick (this turning will be quicker if the intestines are first
  cut into 2-foot lengths), then wash under cold running water until clean.
  Rub the intestines with salt and the juice of 1/2 lemon, rinse again in
  cold water and drain. Braid the intestines or tie the ends together with
  clean string. Put in a large soup pot with the lamb's head, if using, and
  cove with cold water. Bring to a boil, then lower the heat, skim, and
  simmer for 30 minutes. Remove the intestines, drain them, and cut into 1/4
  inch pieces with the scissors and set aside to add to the soup later. (Use
  the remaining portion of the head for another dish.)

  Bring the soup stock to a boil and add the scallions, parsley, dill, and
  celery leaves. Cut the heart, lungs, and liver into small bite-sized
  cubes, and add them to the soup, and simmer for 15 minutes. Add the rice,
  cut-up intestines, aniseed, salt and pepper to taste and continue
  simmering until the rice is tender, approximately 15 minutes, adding more
  water as needed and the brains during the last few minutes of cooking.

  Half an hour before serving, bring the soup to a boil, then remove from
  the heat and prepare the avgolemono: Beat the eggs for 2 minutes. Continue
  to beat, gradually add the remaining lemon juice. Then 1 to 2 cups of the
  hot soup by droplets, beating steadily, until all has been added. Add the
  avgolemono to the soup.  Stir over minimum heat until thickened.  Serve
  warm but avoid boiling the soup after adding the avgolemono.

  A richer Mageritsa can be made by sauteing the scallions in 3 tablespoons
  butter or oil before adding to the soup.

    1/2 c  Chopped fresh parsley
    1/4 c  Chopped fresh mint leaves
      2 tb White wine
    1/4 c  Pine nuts
    1/4 c  Black raisins
           Freshly ground pepper
      4    Peeled tomatoes; drained
    1/3 c  White wine

  Wash and clean the squid, separating the outer sacs from the heads and
  tentacles, removing and discarding the translucent cartilage, and small
  sand bag and ink.  Rub salt on the outer sacs and rinse them inside and
  out with cold water.  Heads and tentacles should be rinsed thoroughly and
  cooked along with the sacs after you stuff the latter.  Drain and set
  aside.

  Heat 1/4 cup of the oil in a heavy frying pan, then add the onion and
  cook, without browning, until transparent.  Stir in the rice and saute a
  few minutes, until golden.  Blend in the parsley, mint, 2 tablespoons
  wine, pine nuts, and raisins, and season with salt and pepper to taste.
  Add enough water to half cover and cook for a few minutes, then stuff the
  squid sacs with the mixture using a very small spoon and allowing enough
  liquid in each for the rice to cook.  Seal opening with skewers or
  toothpicks.  Place the stuffed sacs with the heads and tentacles in a
  baking-serving dish.  Sprinkle with salt and pepper and set aside.

  Meanwhile, combine the tomatoes, 1/3 cup wine, and a little salt and
  pepper in a small saucepan and simmer for 5 minutes.  Pour the sauce over
  the squid and dribble the remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil over the top.
  Bake in a medium-slow oven (300 F) for 1 1/2 hours or until the squid and
  rice are tender and the sauce has thickened.  Serve warm or cold.

      Title: Arni Exohiko ("Surprise" Lamb, Country Style )
 Categories: Greek, Meats, Main dish
   Servings:  8

      2 tb Olive oil
      8    Loin lamb chops
     18    Sheets commercial phyllo
      6 tb Butter; hot and melted
      2 c  Peas; cooked and drained
     16    Potato balls; parboiled
     16    Cherry tomatoes; peeled
    1/2 lb Kasseri cheese; in 8 pieces
           Salt & freshly ground pepper
    3/4 c  Chopped fresh parsley
      1 pn Dried oregano

  *Note: 3/4-inch slices leg of lamb may be used instead of lamb chops.

  In a heavy skillet, heat the oil or butter and fry the lamb over high
  heat, turning frequently.  Lower the heat and simmer for 15 minutes, then
  remove from the heat.  Meanwhile, unroll the filo sheets and cover with a
  damp towel.  In a small pan over low heat, have the butter hot without
  letting it brown. Remove two sheets of filo, brush with hot butter over
  the first, then cover with the second sheet and brush it with butter.  In
  the center of the buttered filo place 1 lamb chop, 2 tablspoons peas, 2
  potato balls, 2 cherry tomatoes, and a slice of kasseri.  Sprinkle with
  salt and pepper, a heaping tablespoon of parsley, and a pinch of oregano.
  Fold the filo around the lamb and vegetables like a sealed parcel.  Place,
  seam side down, on a buttered baking pan (approximately 11 x 15 x 3
  inches) and set aside while you repeat the procedure with the remaining
  ingredients to make 8 "parcels".  Brush hot butter on the tops, then bake
  in a moderate oven (350 F) for 45 to 50 minutes or until golden in color.
  Remove from the oven and arrange on a warm platter or on individual
  dishes.  Serve warm, with a fresh-cooked or raw vegetable salad.

  Note: The vegetables and herbs may be varied.  Substitute green beans or
  lima beans for peas, use thyme or basil instead of oregano.  Arni Exohiko
  is frequently prepared using buttered waxed paper, parchment paper or
  aluminum foil rather than with filo.

      Title: Veal Stifado
 Categories: Greek, Meats, Main dish
   Servings:  5

      2 tb Olive oil
  1 1/2 lb Lean veal; in 1-1/2" cubes
      2    Garlic cloves
           Salt & freshly ground pepper
    1/4 c  Red wine vinegar
      2 tb Dry red wine
      3    Peeled tomatoes; chopped
      1 lg Bay leaf
      1 tb White or brown sugar
  1 1/2 lb Small white onions; peeled
    1/4 c  Chopped fresh parsley
      2 tb Butter; cut into bits
      1    Cinnamon stick
      3    Whole cloves

  In a baking-serving casserole, heat the oil, then add the veal and saute
  on all sides.  Add the garlic and season with salt and pepper.  Stir with
  a wooden spoon, then add the vinegar, wine, tomatoes, bay leaf, sugar, and
  enough water to cover the veal.  Arrange the onions over the meat,
  sprinkle the parsley and butter bits over the top, and slip the spices in
  between the meat and the onions.  Shake the casserole a few times, then
  cover with an inverted plate to keep in place and cover tightly with a lid
  (using a little flour-water paste around the inside of the lid to seal if
  you wish).  Bake in a slow oven (300 F) for 2 to 2-1/2 hours or over
  minimum heat on a burner, until the veal and onions are tender.  Remove
  from the heat and serve warm.

  Note: After peeling the onions, pierce the root end of each onion with the
  tip of a small, sharp knife, then slash again at a right angle to make a
  cross.  This will keep the onion whole and intact during the cooking
  process.

      Title: Pork Braised With Celery Avgolemono
 Categories: Greek, Meats, Main dish
   Servings:  4

      3 lb Lean shoulder or leg of pork
      4 tb Butter or margarine
      1    Onion; finely chopped
           Salt & freshly ground pepper
      3 c  Hot water (approximately)
      1    Bunch celery
      2 tb Flour
      2    Egg yolks
  1 1/2    Lemons (juice only)
           Parsley or celery leaves

  Wipe the pork with damp paper towels, then cut into 1-1/2 inch cubes (the
  fat and skin may be left on during the cooking and removed later).  Melt 2
  tablespoons of the butter in a heavy pan or Dutch oven.  Add the onion and
  cook until soft and transparent, then add the pork and cook, stirring,
  over medium heat until the raw meat color disappears.  Season with salt
  and pepper, add hot water to cover, then cover and simmer gently (or bake
  in a 325 F oven) for 30 to 35 minutes, or until almost tender.  (The
  timing is important because the celery is to be added and cooked with the
  pork only until both are tender but not overcooked.)

  Meanwhile, prepare the celery.  Wash the stalks and scrape the heavy ones
  slightly.  Cut each stalk once lengthwise (if large) and then across into
  1-1/2 inch slices.  (Use the leaves as well, if desired, but a few might
  be saved for a garnish or an accompanying salad.)  Add the celery to pork
  and continue simmering 25 minutes until both are tender.  Using a slotted
  spoon, remove the pork and celery and place in a serving dish, first
  removing and discarding the fat from the meat.  Keep warm.  Skim the fat
  from the cooking liquid, then add water or boil down rapidly to make to
  make 1-1/2 cups.  Keep hot while you prepare the avgolemono.

  To prepare the avgolemono, heat the remaining 2 tablespoons butter in a
  pan.  Stir in the flour, and after cooking over low heat for 1 minute,
  gradually add 2 cups of the hot cooking liquid from the meat.  Stir until
  the sauce comes to a boil.  Meanwhile, in a small bowl, beat the two
  remaining egg yolks and add the lemon juice, droplet by droplet, beating
  all the while.  Beat a little of the thickened cooking liquid into the
  yolk mixture, then add the yolks to the pan of hot liquid.  Mix well and
  cook over low heat until thickened.  Pour the hot sauce over the pork and
  celery, garnish with parsley or celery leaves and serve warm.

  Note: Celeriac may be substituted for the celery.  Use 2-1/2 pounds of
  celeriac, and peel, quarter, and cut it into 1/2 inch slices before adding
  it to the pork.  A little scraped, diced carrot may be added with the
  celery.

 Categories: Greek, Poultry, Main dish
   Servings:  6

      1    Frying or roasting chicken*

           Salt & freshly ground pepper
           Water if necessary

  *Note: Chicken should be about 3 pounds, and cut into serving pieces.

  Wash and dry the chicken.  In a frying pan, heat the oil or butter and
  sear the chicken over high heat, turning constantly to avoid burning the
  chicken.  Remove each piece when reddish in color.  Lower the heat and
  saute the onion until soft, adding butter while stirring.  For a thicker
  sauce, add the flour and cook 2 minutes, then add the wine and tomatoes.
  Simmer until thickened, then strain the sauce into a baking-serving
  casserole.  Sprinkle the herbs over the chicken, season lightly with salt
  and pepper, and shake the casserole gently.  Chicken should be almost
  covered with liquid; if not, add a little water.  Cover tightly and simmer
  over low heat or transfer to a medium oven (350 F) to bake for 1 hour, or
  until the chicken is tender and the sauce thick.  Serve warm.

      Title: Imam Bayaldi (Eggplant Stuffed With Aromatics)
 Categories: Greek, Vegetarian, Vegetables
   Servings:  5

  2 1/2 lb Eggplants
           Salt
      3 md Onions; peeled and sliced
    1/2 c  Water
      5 tb Olive oil
      5    Fresh tomatoes;
           - peeled and sliced, -=OR=-
      8    -Canned plum tomatoes,sliced
    1/2 c  Chopped fresh parsley
      4    Garlic cloves
           - peeled and sliced
           Freshly ground pepper
      1 pn Granulated sugar
           Fresh parsley for garnish

  *Note: 8 canned plum tomatoes, sliced, may be substituted for the 5 fresh.

  Wash the eggplants, cut off the stem end if using large ones and cut in
  half lengthwise.  With the tip of a sharp knife, make at least 3
  lengthwise slashes on the cut sides of the eggplants, being careful not to
  pierce the skin on the opposite side.   Sprinkle with salt and let stand
  for 30 minutes.  Rinse with cold water, dry, and invert to drain.

  Meanwhile, put the onions in a small pan with the 1/2 cup water and simmer
  a few minutes.  Drain and discard the water or save for soup.

  In a medium frying pan, heat 2 tablespoons of the oil and saute the onions
  until soft, then put approximately a third of them in the bottom of a
  buttered casserole large enough to accomodate all the eggplants. Set 4 to
  5 tomato slices over the onions in the casserole and add the rest of the
  tomatoes to the onion remaining in the frying pan. Saute onions and
  tomatoes for 10 minutes, then stir in all but 2 tablespoons of the parsley
  and remove from the heat.  Set the eggplants into the casserole, tuck a
  slice of garlic into each eggplant slash, and stuff the slashes with the
  filling, allowing some to cover the top of the eggplant.  Season lightly
  with salt, pepper, and a pinch of sugar, then dribble the remaining oil
  and chopped parsley over the eggplants.  Cover the casserole with a lid or
  aluminum foil and bake in a moderate oven (350 F) for 30 to 40 minutes,
  until fork-tender, removing the cover during the last 10 minutes, to allow
  the sauce to thicken.  Garnish with parsley and serve warm.

  Note: This is excellent as a first course of a subsequently light meal
  topped with fresh fruit and Turkish coffee.

  If you wish, you may leave the eggplants whole, slash one side and remove
  some of the pulp with a small spoon.  This pulp is then sauteed with the
  filing and stuffed into the eggplant, a very attractive method for the
  smaller eggplants.  As you might suspect, both variations may also be
  prepared on top of the stove.

      Title: Eggplant Stuffing
 Categories: Greek, Vegetarian
   Servings:  6

      3 md Eggplants (1 lb ea.)
    1/4 c  Olive oil
    1/3 c  Chopped scallions
           -=OR=- Shallots
      1    Garlic clove; sliced (opt.)
    1/4 c  Chopped fresh parsley
      2 tb Chopped fresh fennel or dill
    1/2 ts Allspice; more if necessary
    1/4 c  Dry white wine
      2 tb Tomato paste; MIXED WITH:
    1/2 c  Water
           Salt & freshly ground pepper
    1/2 c  Bread crumbs

  Cut the eggplants in half lengthwise.  With a small knife, cut away the
  eggplant flesh from the skin without breaking the skin (if planning to
  stuff the shells, leave 1/4-inch of the flesh with the skin as a firm
  base) and set the shells aside.  Dice the eggplant flesh and push through
  the medium blade of a meat grinder as quickly as possible to avoid
  discoloration.  (Or the eggplant may be pureed in a blender or food
  processor.)

  Heat the oil in a frying pan and saute the scallions and garlic.  Add the
  parsley, fennel, allspice, wine, and the diluted tomato paste.  Stir in
  the eggplant pulp, season with salt and pepper, and simmer for 20 minutes.
  Taste to adjust seasonings.  Add the bread crumbs to absorb excess liquid.

  Stuff the eggplant shells, if desired, and place in an oiled baking dish.
  Bake in a moderate oven (350 F) for 35 minutes.  Serve warm - or
  particularly good - cold.

      Title: Halvah
 Categories: Greek, Desserts
   Servings: 12

      3 c  Water
      2 c  Granulated sugar
      1    Cinnamon stick
      3    Whole cloves
      1    Lemon (peel only)
    1/2 c  Butter
      1 c  Coarse semolina or farina
      4 tb Pine nuts
      2 tb Blanched, chopped almonds
      3 tb Whole blanched almonds

  Combine the water, sugar, cinnamon stick, cloves, and lemon peel (or 1
  tablespoon lemon juice) in a heavy saucepan and bring to a boil. Boil for
  10 minutes, then cool.

  Meanwhile, slowly melt the butter in a heavy saucepan, and cook for
  several minutes, without browning. Stirring constantly with a wooden
  spoon, slowly add the semolina or farina. Cook over low heat until the
  mixture turns a golden chestnut color; do not brown. Add 2 tablespoons of
  the pine nuts and chopped almonds and continue cooking 1 more minute.

  Remove cinnamon stick, cloves, and peel from the cooled syrup. Gradually
  add the syrup to the semolina mixture, stirring with a long-handled wooden
  spoon; the mixture will bubble furiously. Cook over the lowest possible
  heat until the syrup has been absorbed and the mixture thickens. Remove
  from the heat and drape with a clean towel for 10 minutes. Turn into a
  mold, spreading with a knife or a spatula. Cool, then reverse onto a
  serving platter, sprinkle with cinnamon, and garnish decoratively with the
  remaining pine nuts and the whole almonds. Cut into small, diamond-shaped
  pieces.

      1 sm Leg of lamb - boned, cut into 1" pieces,
      1    Lemon (juice only)
    1/4 c  Oil or butter
      1    Onion; chopped
      3 md Potatoes; parboiled in their jackets, peeled & diced
      1 lg Carrot; parboiled, diced
      3 c  Parboiled white rice;drained
      2 tb Tomato puree
      1 c  Feta cheese, crumbled
    1/2 c  Chopped fresh parsley
      2    Sprigs fresh mint; chopped
      1 ts Dried oregano
      1    Garlic clove; sliced
      1 ts Ground cinnamon
      1    Orange or lemon peel cut into pieces
           Salt & freshly ground pepper
     16    Commercial filo sheets
      6 tb Butter (or more); melted
      3    Hard-boiled eggs; quartered

  On the island of Kefallinia in the Ionion Sea, the Feast Day of Analipseos
  (Ascension Day) is celebrated with the traditional "kreatopita"
  (meat-pie). This spicy pie also ushers in the beginning of Lent on the day
  of Apokreas.

  In a stock pot, cover the lamb bones with cold water. Simmer, covered for
  1 hour. Strain, boil down to 1 cup, and set aside. Sprinkle the lemon
  juice on the lamb cubes. Heat the oil or butter in a heavy pan, add the
  onions and lamb, and saute the meat on all sides until the onions are soft
  without browning. Pour the onions, lamb, and juices into a large bowl. Add
  the diced potatoes and carrot, rice, tomato puree, cheese, parsley, mint,
  oregano, garlic, cinnamon, and fruit peel and season with salt and freshly
  ground pepper. Add enough reserved lamb broth for liquid while pie bakes,
  then mix with a wooden spoon.

  Butter the bottom and sides of a 9 x 12 x 3 inch pan. Spread 8 filo
  sheets, brushing the melted butter in between the sheets, making sure the
  pastry fits the sides and bottom of the pan. Pour in the filling,
  spreading evenly with a spatula. Place the egg quarters here and there
  across the top and cover with the remaining filo sheets, brushing with
  butter as before. Flute the edges with two fingers or a fork and brush the
  top with butter. Using a sharp knife, score the top 3 filo sheets into
  square or diamond shapes, or prick the homemade pastry with a fork. Bake
  for 40 to 50 minutes in moderately slow oven (325 F), raising the
  temperature to 350 F during the last 10 minutes. Remove from the oven and
  let stand on a rack for 15 minutes. Remove from the oven and let stand on
  a rack for 15 minutes. Cut into diamonds or squares and serve warm.

      Title: Lamb Pie, Ioannina Style
 Categories: Greek, Meats, Main dish
   Servings: 10

      2 tb Butter or margarine
      1 md Onion; chopped
  1 1/2 lb Lean lamb (pref.leg), ground
      1 ts Ground cinnamon (or more)
           Salt & freshly ground pepper
      1 c  Tomato sauce or puree diluted w/ water & warmed
    1/2 c  Chopped fresh parsley

  a fork until the raw color disappears. Season the meat with cinnamon,
  salt, pepper, then stir in the tomato sauce and parsley. Cover the pan and
  simmer for 20 minutes. (This much can be cooked a day in advance and
  stored in the refrigerator.) Meanwhile, soak the toast slices in the milk
  to make a soft mixture, and add to the meat along with the eggs and
  cheese. Mix the filling with a wooden spoon, taste, and add more cinnamon
  if you like.

  Butter the bottom and sides of a 9 x 12 x 3 inch baking pan. Spread 6 filo
  sheets, brushing melted butter in between the sheets, making sure the

      Title: Kotopita (Greek Chicken Pie)
 Categories: Greek, Poultry, Main dish
   Servings: 10

      1    Chicken, stewed
    1/4 c  Butter or margarine
    1/4 c  All-purpose flour
  2 1/2 c  Chicken broth/stock; warmed
    1/4 c  Milk, optional
      3    Eggs; lightly beaten
    3/4 c  Grated cheese *(see note)
           Salt & freshly ground pepper
      1 ts Grated nutmeg
           Thyme or mint leaves;chopped
     12    Commercial filo sheets

  *Note: Suggested cheeses are either Mizithra or Kefalotyri.  If
  unavailable, Parmesan or Romano could be substituted.  :-(

  Remove the bones and skin from chicken and discard.  With your fingers
  tear the chicken into strips, not too small.  Set aside while you prepare
  the sauce.  Melt the 4 T butter in a heavy pan, then blend in the flour,
  without scorching, over medium heat.  Remove from the heat for a minute
  and stir in the warm broth, then return to the heat and cook gently until
  the sauce boils.  Cool.  Mix in the milk if the sauce seems too thick,
  then add the eggs, cheese, a little salt, pepper, nutmeg, and thyme.

  Butter a 9 x 12 x 3-inch baking pan and in it spread 6 filo sheets,
  brushing each with melted butter.  Pour in the chicken filling, then cover
  with the remaining filo sheets.  Tuck the top filo over the bottom and
  flute the edges.  Score the top 3 filo sheets with a sharp knife.  Bake in
  a moderate oven (350 F) for 40 minutes, or until crisp and golden chestnut
  in color.  Remove from oven and let stand for 15 minutes before cutting
  into 9 to 12 squares.  Serve warm.  (Serves 9 to 12)

  Note: In Epirus, Kotopita is sometimes made with a large amount of onions.
  If you would like to try it, use the recipe above plus 1 pound of Spanish-
  type onions.  Peel and slice the onions, boil in water for 5 minutes, and
  drain.  Prepare the sauce without the cheese and bake the chicken and
  onions in the sauce, between homemade filo, preferably, or commercial
  filo.

      Title: Spanakopita
 Categories: Greek, Vegetarian, Main dish
   Servings: 12

    1/3 c  Olive oil or butter
      1 sm Bunch scallions; chopped
      3 lb Spinach; washed & drained
      1 sm Bunch parsley; chopped
      1 sm Bunch fresh dill; chopped
           Salt & freshly ground pepper
    1/2 lb Feta cheese, crumbled
      4    Eggs; lightly beaten
     12    Commercial filo sheets
      6 tb Butter; melted
           Bread crumbs, if necessary

  Heat the 1/3 cup oil in a large pan and saute the scallions until soft.
  Meanwhile, pan the spinach (cook it without adding water, then drain it
  thoroughly)  or salt and rinse it (the latter method is used extensively
  in Greece, but it not advisable).  Squeeze out excess liquid.  Add the
  spinach to scallions and stir in the parsley, dill, and a very little salt
  and pepper.  Cook gently for 10 minutes, then cool.  (This much can be
  done in advance and stored in the refrigerator).  Using a wooden spoon,
  stir in the feta and eggs.

  Butter a 9 x 12 x 3-inch baking pan and in it spread 6 filo sheets,
  brushing each with melted butter.  Pour in the spinach filling, then cover
  with the remaining filo sheets (buttering each as before).  Tuck the top
  filo over the bottom and flute the edges.  Score the top 3 filo sheets
  into square or diamond shapes.  Bake in a moderate oven (350 F) for 40
  minutes, or until crisp and a golden chestnut color.  Remove from oven and
  let stand for 15 minutes before cutting.  Serve warm.

  Note: Some of the favorite variations: Use some nutmeg, or substitute mint
  for the dill; use grated cheese instead of feta (be discreet with the salt
  if the cheese is salty); add a small handful of raw long-grain white rice
  to the filling.  You will surely invent your own flavor combinations which
  is why spanakopita is so great.

      Title: Pita Of Greens, Herbs & Eggs
 Categories: Greek, Vegetarian
   Servings: 12

      2 lb Fresh greens *
           Salt (see note at end)
    1/2 bn Fresh parsley; chopped
    1/2 bn Fresh dill; chopped
      1    Handful fresh chervil; chop.
    1/4 c  Butter or margarine
      1 bn Scallions; chopped
    1/2 ts Ground allspice
    1/2 ts Ground cinnamon
    1/2 ts Nutmeg
      2 ts Granulated sugar
           Salt & freshly ground pepper
      5    Eggs; lightly beaten
      1 c  Crumbled feta cheese
    1/2 c  Milk, or more
    1/2 c  Butter (optional); melted
     12    Commercial filo sheets

  Traditional and individualistic.  Village women learn to gather tender,
  young greens from their rocky surroundings, which ironically produce the
  most beautiful wild flowers and delicious greens.  When greens are bought
  in the markets, spinach is the most frequently substituted.  Cretans
  combine dandelions and spinach.  This recipe is written as recipes are
  spoken in Greece, in the warm first-person plural.

  *Note: Suggested greens are: Spinach, dandelions, chicory, endive or any
  other fresh greens.

  First we wash the spinach, trim coarse ends, drain, chop, sprinkle with
  salt, and squeeze until all liquid has been drained.  Now we combine the
  spinach in a large bowl with the parsley, dill, and chervil and mix
  thoroughly.  Allowing the greens to stand while heating the 1/4 cup butte
  in a large frying pan, we add the scallions to the butter and saute them
  until the white parts are translucent.  Continuing to cook over medium
  heat, we add the greens, the spices, sugar, and enough salt and pepper for
  seasoning, careful to allow for additional salt in the feta, which will be
  added later.  We partially cover the pan and simmer for 20 minutes, or
  until all the liquid has been absorbed, then we remove it from the heat
  and cool the mixture in a large bowl.  Now we add the eggs, feta, and
  enough milk to saturate the greens, mix, and assemble the pita as follows:

  Butter a 15 x 11 x 2-inch baking pan.  Spread 6 filo sheets, brushing each
  with melted butter.  Pour in the filling, spreading evenly.  Cover with
  the remaining filo sheets, brushing each with butter.  Flute the edges and
  brush top with butter.  Using a sharp knife, score the top 3 filo sheets
  into square or diamond shapes.  Bake for 45 minutes in a moderate oven
  (350 F) and allow to cool slightly before slicing and serving it warm.

  Note: You may eliminate the salting of the spinach by panning it, cooking
  over very low heat until the leaves wilt, and then draining it thoroughly.

      Title: Domates Yemistes (Stuffed Tomatoes)
 Categories: Greek, Main dish
   Servings:  6

     12    Firm, ripe tomatoes
           Salt
           Granulated sugar
      3 tb Olive oil or butter
      1 md Onion; finely chopped
      2    Garlic cloves; chopped
    1/4 c  Chopped fresh parsley
    1/2 lb Lean lamb or veal, ground
    1/4 c  Dry white wine
    1/4 c  Water
      6 tb Raw long-grain white rice
           Tomato juice (if necessary)
           Freshly ground pepper
      2    Sprigs fresh mint or basil
      1 pn Grated nutmeg

  Wash the tomatoes, then turn each stem-side down, and with a sharp knife
  carefully cut the end now up to make an opening or "cap" being careful not
  to detach the cap entirely.  With a small spoon, carefully, without
  breaking the outer skin of the tomatoes, scoop the pulp into a bowl.
  Place the tomato shells in a baking-serving dish large enough to support
  them touching.  Sprinkle the inside of the shells with salt and sugar.

  Meanwhile, prepare the stuffing.  Heat the oil in a heavy skillet and add
  the onions.  Cook over moderate heat until soft and transparent, then add
  the garlic and parsley, and blend.  Add the meat, mashing with a fork,
  then add the wine and water, cover, and simmer for a few minutes.  Add the
  rice and tomato pulp and stir.  (Tomato juice may be added if necessary,
  since the mixture should provide enough liquid for the rice to absorb.)
  Cover the skillet and simmer about 7 minutes, then add salt, pepper, mint
  or basil, and nutmeg.  Taste for seasoning. Remove from heat, and fill the
  tomatoes up about two-thirds of the way with the stuffing and liquid.
  Cover with tomato caps, brush with oil.  Bake in a moderate oven (350 F)
  until the rice is tender (approximately 50 minutes to 1 hour), basting
  inside the tomatoes with liquid released by them.  Serve warm.

  Note: For Tomatoes stuffed with Rice, use 1 1/4 cups raw long-grain white
  rice instead of the meat and rice in the above recipe, eliminate the wine,
  and include with the other seasonings a few tablespoons each of black
  raisins and 2 tablespoons pine nuts, if desired.  Rice in baked stuffed
  dishes takes much longer to cook then over a burner.  Stuffed green
  peppers, also popular in Greece, can be made the same way with an entirely
  different flavor.

      Title: Kalitsounia Me Kanella (Cretan Cheese-cinnamon Pastries)
 Categories: Greek, Cookies, Desserts
   Servings: 20

  1 1/2 c  Fresh mizithra or ricotta
      2 tb Grated hard ricotta
      2    Eggs; separated
    1/2 c  Granulated sugar
      2 tb Butter; melted
      4 tb Milk (or more)
      2 c  All-purpose flour
      1 pn Salt
      1 ts Vanilla extract
           Confectioners' sugar

  For the filling, combine the cheeses, lightly beaten egg yolks, sugar, 1/2
  teaspoon cinnamon, and melted butter in a bowl. The mixture should be thick
  enough to mound, but not stiff; add 1 tablespoon milk, if necessary.  Set
  aside while you make the dough.

  Sift the flour and salt into a bowl, then cut in the butter and mix by
  rubbing between your fingers.  Mix in the vanilla, egg whites, and enough
  milk to make a soft dough.  Knead until smooth and elastic, then break off
  small pieces and roll as thin of a dime.  (The dough will be elastic and
  can be rolled easily.)  Cut into circles 4-inches in diameter (teacup
  size), then on each circle place a teaspoon of the cheese filling.  Wet
  the circle edge with water or milk and fold over to form a half-moon, then
  seal with the tines of a fork or pastry wheel.  Arrange the Kaltisounia on
  buttered cookie sheets and bake in a moderate oven (350 F) for 25 minutes,
  or until the pastry puffs up and turns a light chestnut color.  Remove
  from the oven, and place on racks, and dust with confectioners' sugar and
  cinnamon.  Serve hot or cold.

      Title: Svingi (Batter Puffs With Honey And Cinnamon)
 Categories: Greek, Desserts
   Servings: 28

      1 c  Boiling water
      4 tb Butter or margarine
    1/4 ts Salt
      1 tb Granulated sugar
    1/2 ts Grated orange rind
      1 c  All-purpose flour
      1 ts Baking powder
      4    Eggs
           Olive or other vegetable oil
           Honey; warmed
           Ground cinnamon

  In a medium-sized saucepan, combine the boiling water, butter, salt,
  sugar, and orange rind.  Bring to a boil.  Meanwhile, sift together the
  flour and baking powder.  Add the dry ingredients all at once to the hot
  mixture, beating hard with a wooden spoon over medium heat until the
  mixture forms a compact mass and leaves the sides of the pan.  Remove from
  the heat and let cool for 1 minute.  Add the eggs, one at a time, beating
  hard after each addition; the mixture should be smooth, glossy, and thick.
  Heat the oil (which should be 2-1/2 to 3 inches deep) almost to the
  smoking point, then drop the batter by tablespoons into the oil, without
  crowding, to form puffs.  When the puffs surface, turn them to fry on all
  sides, using tongs, then lift them out, drain off excess oil on absorbent
  paper.  Place on warm platter and keep warm.  If using the syrup, boil the
  syrup ingedients for 5 minutes; spoon the syrup, or warm honey, over the
  puffs, sprinkle with cinnamon, and serve hot.

      Title: Melomakarona * Phoenikia
 Categories: Greek, Desserts
   Servings: 40

  1 1/2 c  Honey
  1 1/2 c  Granulated sugar
      1 c  Water
      1 tb Lemon juice
      1 lb Finely chopped walnuts
  1 1/4 c  Sweet butter; softened
      4 ts Ground cinnamon (or more)
  1 1/2 c  Light vegetable oil
    1/2 c  Confectioners' sugar
      2 lg Oranges Strained juice only
      2 tb Cognac or brandy
    1/4 ts Ground cloves
    1/2 ts Grated nutmeg
      1 ts Baking powder
    1/2 ts Baking soda
      6 c  All-purpose flour (or more)
      2 oz Finely chopped walnuts

  (Author's Note):
  Ancient and traditional small, spicy baked syruped cakes, these are
  perfect for a large buffet.  The nickname asserts their introduction into
  Greece by the Phoenicians, but not with these ingredients!  Within my
  lifetime I have seen the oil give way to butter and semolina succumb to
  flour.

  Combine the honey, granulated sugar, water, and lemon juice in a saucepan
  and boil for 5 minutes.  Remove from the heat.  Combine the 1 pound finely
  chopped walnuts with 1/4 cup of the softened butter, 2 teaspoons of the
  cinnamon, and 5 tablespoons of the syrup.  Reserve the remaining syrup and
  set the filling aside while you prepare the dough.

  Using an electric mixer, cream the remaining butter (1 cup) with the oil
  until light and fluffy. Gradually add the confectioners' sugar, beating on
  medium speed.  Add the orange juice slowly to the batter, along with the
  Cognac or brandy, 1 teaspoon of the cinnamon, and the other spices.  In a
  small bowl, sift the baking powder, soda, and 2 cups of the flour
  together.  Slowly add the flour mixture to the batter and beat for a few
  minutes.  Continuing to mix by hand, add only enough remaining flour to
  make a soft dough.  Knead.

  Break off small pieces of the dough and shape with your fingers into
  oblongs about 2-1/2-inches long and 1-inch high.  Flatten between your
  palms and place 1 teaspoon of the filling mixture in the center.  Work the
  dough around the filling to enclose it completely and press firmly to
  seal.  This procedure sounds difficult, but with many hands it is quite
  simple.  Place on a cookie sheet and continue until all the cakes are
  shaped.  Bake in a moderate oven (350 F) for 25 minutes, then cool on a
  rack.  Bring the syrup back to a boil.  Dip each cake into the syrup and
  arrange on a platter.  Sprinkle with the remaining chopped walnuts and
  teaspoon cinnamon, or more if desired.  Cool before storing.

  Note: You may bake and cool melomakarona, store a few days in advance and
  dip in syrup as described above a day or so before serving.  The flavor
  improves after a few days.

    1/2 lb Sweet butter
      2 c  Granulated sugar
      4    Eggs
      1    Orange,(juice & grated rind)
      3 c  All-purpose flour

  2 1/2 c  Granulated sugar
      3 c  Cold water
      1 sm Cinnamon stick
      3    Whole cloves
      1    Orange (peel only)
    1/2 lb Sweet butter
      6    Eggs; room temperature
      1 c  All-purpose flour
      1 c  Fine semolina
      3 ts Baking powder
      1 c  Finely chopped almonds *

  together.  Very gradually add to the batter, beating on medium speed, then
  pour in the vanilla and brandy and give the batter a last whirl on high
  speed for a few seconds.  Pour immediately into a buttered 9 x 12 x 3-inch
  cake pan and bake on the center rack of a moderate oven (350 F) for 30 to
  35 minutes, or until the cake springs back when touched by a finger.
  Remove from the oven and set the pan on a cake rack.  Using a sharp knife,

      Title: Rafiola Kokokarion (Coconut Pastries W/ Glaceed Fruit)
 Categories: Greek, Desserts
   Servings: 20

      3    Potatoes
      3 tb Granulated sugar
      1 pn Salt
      2    Egg yolks
      4 c  Finely shredded coconut
  1 1/2 c  Glaceed fruit
           Confectioners' sugar

  (Author's note): In a Cretan zacharoplasteion (sweet shop), we were so
  intrigued by these coconut pastries (among the newer breed) that I tried
  them at home. You can expect the potato pastry to be a bit difficult to
  manipulate, and you can also anticipate compliments on the results.
  Attractive and tasty, not excessively sweet.

  Boil the potatoes in their jackets until fork tender, then drain and
  remove the skins and all spots. Return the potatoes to the pan and dry
  over medium heat, shaking pan constantly. Push the potatoes through a mill
  or ricer, then combine in a large bowl with the sugar and salt. When
  somewhat cool, add the egg yolks and coconut and knead until smooth.
  Refrigerate for 2 hours.

  Remove the dough from the refrigerator and knead until smooth enough to
  roll. If sticky, dust lightly with flour. Roll out on a floured board to
  1/4-inch thickness, then, using a glass with a 3-1/2-inch diameter, cut
  the pastry into rounds.

  Meanwhile, mince the glaceed fruit. Place 1 tablespoon on the center of
  each of the pastry rounds. Lift one side with a spatula and fold over the
  other half, forming a half-circle. Press the edges together and place on a
  baking sheet. Continue until all have been stuffed, then bake in a
  moderate oven (350 F) for 15 minutes, or until firm; the pastries will be
  white. Remove and cool for 10 minutes, then roll in confectioners' sugar
  and cool completely. Store in a covered container.

  Note: In Crete this pastry is cut with a serrated pastry cutter producing
  an attractive edging.

      Title: Nut-stuffed Semolina Pastries, Cyprus Style
 Categories: Greek, Desserts
   Servings: 30

    1/4 lb Sweet butter
  1 1/4 c  Fine semolina
           Orange flower water
    1/4 ts Salt
      3 tb Warm water (more if needed)
      1 c  Chopped unsalted pistachios
  4 1/2 tb Granulated sugar
      1 tb Ground cinnamon
           Confectioners' sugar

  In a small, heavy saucepan, bring the butter to bubbling over medium heat
  and stir in the fine semolina.  Transfer to a small bowl, cover, and let
  stand overnight at room temperature.  The next day, uncover and add 2
  teaspoons orange flower water, the salt, and gradually the warm water,
  working with your fingers to make a firm dough.  Knead for 5 minutes, then
  cover and let rest 1 hour.  Meanwhile, combine the pistachios, sugar, and
  ground cinnamon in a small bowl.

  Break off pieces of dough slightly larger in size than a walnut.  Work in
  your fingers to form a ball.  Press the center with your thumb to make a
  large well and fill with 1 teaspoon of the nut mixture, then cover over
  with dough and shape into an oval. Set on a cookie sheet and continue
  until all pastries are shaped.  Bake in a moderate oven (350 F) for 30 to
  35 minutes or until the yellow color has become a light, not a deep,
  chestnut.  Remove to racks and cool for 10 minutes, then dip quickly into
  orange flower water and roll in confectioners' sugar.  Cool before
  storing.

  Note: You may substitute blanched almonds for the pistachios and peanut
  oil for the butter.

      Title: Pasta Flora, Athens Style
 Categories: Greek, Desserts
   Servings: 36

    1/2 lb Sweet butter
    1/2 c  Granulated sugar
      2    Eggs
      6 tb Cognac
      2 c  All-purpose flour (or more)
    1/4 ts Salt
    1/2 ts Baking powder
      2 c  Stewed apricots
      4    Dried figs
    1/3 c  Raisins
      1    Orange (grated rind only)
      1 c  Apricot jam
      1 tb Lemon juice (optional)
      2 ts Cornstarch
    1/3 c  Orange juice

  Using an electric mixer, beat the butter until light and fluffy and
  gradually add the sugar, 1 egg and an egg yolk, and 3 tablespoons of the
  Cognac, beating thoroughly after each addition.  Sift 2 cups of the flour
  with the salt and baking powder and add slowly to the batter, while
  beating on medium speed.  Remove the beaters and finish by hand, adding
  only enough flour to make a soft dough.  Knead.  Cover and refrigerate for
  at least 30 minutes.

  Meanwhile, slice the apricots into uniform pieces and place in an enameled
  pan.  Soak the figs and raisins in the remaining Cognac until swollen,
  then mince and add to the apricots along with the orange rind, jam, and
  lemon juice and stir into the apricot mixture, then cook over medium heat
  until thick, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon.  Cool.

  Remove the dough from the refrigerator and set aside about one-third for
  the latticed top.   Using your fingers (the dough will be too soft to
  roll), press the larger portion of dough into a buttered 9 x 12 x 2-inch
  baking pan, pressing evenly about 1/4-inch up the sides.  Pour the filling
  into the dough-lined pan.

  Divide the remaining dough into walnut-sized balls and roll each ball into
  1/2-inch strips.  Using the strips, make a lattice over the top of the
  pastry.  If using a glaze, beat the remaining egg white slightly with a
  fork and brush on the dough stips.  Bake in a moderate oven (350 F) for 45
  minutes, or until golden in color.  Remove and cool in the pan on a rack.
  To serve, cut into 1-1/2-inch (or smaller) squares with a sharp knife.

  Note: You may prefer to use peaches and peach jam, strawberries and
  strawberry jam, and so on, instead of apricots; also diced candied peel
  adds a colorful note when substituting for figs; and slivered almonds may
  be added to the filling.

      Title: Galaktoboureko
 Categories: Greek, Desserts
   Servings: 20

      6 c  Milk
      1 c  Fine semolina
  3 1/2 tb Cornstarch
      3 c  Granulated sugar
    1/4 ts Salt
      6    Eggs
      1 ts Vanilla extract (optional)
      1 tb Butter
     12    Commercial filo sheets
    3/4 c  Butter; melted & hot
      1 c  Water
      1    Lemon or orange (peel only)
      2 tb Fine brandy or Cognac (opt.)

  In a heavy-bottomed, 3-quart saucepan, bring the milk gradually to a boil;
  do not allow it to scorch.  Meanwhile, sift the semolina, cornstarch, 1
  cup of the sugar, and salt together and gradually add to the boiling milk,
  stirring constantly with a wooden spoon.  Cook slowly over medium heat
  until the mixture thickens and comes to a full boil, then remove from the
  heat.

  Beat the eggs on high speed of an electric mixer.  Gradually add 1/2 cup
  sugar and continue beating until very thick and fluffy, about 10 minutes,
  then add the vanilla.  Stirring constantly, add eggs to the hot pudding.
  Partially cover the pan and allow to cool.  Butter a 9 x 12 x 3-inch
  baking pan and cover the bottom with 7 sheets of the filo, brushing butter
  generously between each and making sure that a few sheets come up the pan
  sides.  Pour the custard into the pan over the filo.  Cover with the 5
  remaining sheets, brushing butter between each and on the surface.  With
  the tip of a very sharp knife, score the top filo sheets into square or
  diamond shapes, being careful not to score as deeply as the custard.  Bake
  on the center rack of a moderate (350 F) oven for 40 to 45 minutes, until
  crisp and golden chestnut in color and the custard is firm.

  Meanwhile, boil the remaining 1-1/2 cups sugar with the water and lemon or
  orange peel for 5 minutes.  Add the brandy or Cognac, if desired, and set
  aside.

  Remove the galaktoboureko from the oven and set on a cake rack.  Spoon the
  hot syrup over the entire galaktoboureko, particularly the edges.  Cool
  thoroughly before cutting and serving.  Store in the refrigerator.

      Title: Byzantine Dolmathes (Stuffed Grapeleaves)
 Categories: Greek, Appetizers, Main dish
   Servings: 60

      1    Jar grapeleaves (or fresh)
      2 tb Oil
      1 lb Ground beef or lamb
      2    Onions; chopped
      1    Garlic clove; pressed
      2 c  Water
    1/2 c  Tomato sauce
      1 c  Rice
      2 tb Chopped mint
      2 tb Chopped parsley
    1/2 ts Salt
           Pepper to taste
    1/8 ts Cinnamon
    1/2 c  Currants
    1/4 c  Port wine (optional)
    1/4 c  Pine nuts or walnuts
      2 c  Water
      1    Lemon (juice only)
      3    Eggs
      2    Lemons (stained juice only)
      1 c  Hot broth

  If using canned grape leaves, rinse off brine by floating leaves in a
  basin of cold water.  Prepare fresh vine leaves by pouring a cup of
  boiling water over them in a bowl.  Drain.  Spread 5 or 6 leaves out at a
  time on a flat surface.  Lay leaf stem side up.  Snip off stem with
  kitchen shears.

  MAKE FILLING:  Heat oil in large frying pan.  Fry meat, onions and garlic
  on medium heat for 5 minutes, mixing it as it cooks.  Add water and
  remaining ingredients.  Bring to a boil.  Cover.  Reduce heat to simmer
  and cook 10 minutes, until water is absorbed.  Set aside until cool enough
  to handle.  Put 1 teaspoon of filling near stem.  Bring left side of leaf
  towards center, then bring right side towards center.  They will not
  always meet.  Pick up stem end of leaf, tucking in the filling.  Roll away
  from you.  It will be an oblong roll like a sausage.

  Line the bottom of a large skillet with 4 leaves.  Place each roll so that
  the tucked under end is on the bottom.  Arrange each roll snugly, one next
  to the other, until all the leaves (except 3), and filling are gone.
  Place these leaves flat on top of rolls.  Place a flat dish on top of
  rolls also to prevent their unravelling during cooking.

  Add water and lemon juice.  Bring to a boil.  Cover.  Reduce heat to
  simmer and cook 45 minutes.  When done, remove pot from fire.  Make Egg
  and Lemon Sauce and add to broth immediately or serve without sauce either
  cold as an appetizer or as a hot entree.

  EGG AND LEMON SAUCE: Beat eggs until thick and light yellow, at least 5
  minutes, with an electric beater or 10 to 15 minutes by hand.  Add juice
  slowly, beating all the while.  Mix 1 cup hot broth into beaten eggs,
  stirring it in quickly with spoon (or wire whisk) so heat will not curdle
  the eggs.  Cook over very low heat until thickened.

      Title: Honey Nut Rolls (Bourekakia)
 Categories: Greek, Desserts
   Servings:  1

      2 c  Chopped nuts (or more) *
    1/4 c  Sugar
    1/2 ts Cinnamon
      1    Orange (grated rind only)
    1/2 lb Commercial filo sheets
    1/2 lb Sweet butter; melted
      2 c  Honey
      1 c  Water
      2 c  Sugar
      1 tb Lemon juice

  *Note: Nuts may be walnuts, almonds, pecans, pistachios or any
  combination.

  Defrost filo to room temperature at least 2 hours before using.  Mix
  filling in a bowl and set aside.  Melt butter in a small pan, and return
  to heat when it cools and doesn't flow easily while you are working with
  filo.

  Smooth 3 sheets of filo flat on a cutting board.  With a pastry brush,
  dribble warm butter between sheets.  Sprinkle 2/3 cup of nut filling over
  top, spreading to corners. Lay another 3 sheets of filo over filling,
  buttering between them.  Fold edges over on each side to keep nuts from
  rolling out.  Starting with the end nearest to you, roll away from you as
  tightly as you can.  Cut into 1" slices.  Place each roll in oiled pan,
  next to each other, snugly, nuts facing upwards.  Continue using all the
  filo and filling.  When all the slices are in the pan, dribble a teaspoon
  of warm butter on top of each slice.  It will disappear into the layers of
  nutmeats.

  Bake at 350 F for 45 minutes.  Begin making syrup 20 minutes before the
  pastry is ready to be taken out of the oven.  Pour hot syrup over rolls
  immediately upon removal from oven.  Use a spoon to ladle it over each
  one.  Set aside to absorb syrup for 4 hours.  Do not refrigerate.

      Title: Anginares Me Anitho - Artichokes With Dill
 Categories: Greek, Main dish, Appetizers, Vegetables, Vegetarian
   Servings:  8

     12 md Globe artichokes
      1    Lemon (juice only)
           Lemon slices
      3 tb Flour (optional)
    1/2 c  Chopped scallinos,white only
    1/4 c  Olive or other oil
      1    Lemon (juice only)
      3 c  Water
           Salt
           Freshly ground white pepper
      2 tb Finely chopped dill
      3 ts Cornflour
           Cold water
      2    Eggs
           Chopped dill for garnish

  Serves: 4 as a light meal, 8 as a first course
  Cooking time: 45-50 minutes

  Wash artichokes well and cut off stem close to base.  Have ready a bowl of
  cold water with the juice of 1 lemon and some lemon slices added.  If
  desired stir in 2-3 tablespoons flour as this is quite effective in
  preventing discoloration.

  As each artichoke is prepared, rub cut surfaces with a lemon slice from
  the bowl and place in bowl until all are prepared.  Cook as soon as
  possible after preparation.

  Remove 3 or 4 layers of leaves until the tender inner leaves remain.
  Scoop out choke and pink thorny leaves from centre, using a spoon or melon
  ball scoop.  Cut in half.

  In a large pan gently fry spring onion in oil until soft.  Add juice of
  1/2 lemon, water, about 2 teaspoons salt and a good grinding of pepper.
  Bring to the boil.

  Drain prepared artichokes and add to pan with dill.  Return to a slow
  simmer, cover and simmer gently for 30 minutes or until artichokes are
  tender.  Stain cooking liquid into a pan and boil until reduced to half
  original quantity (about 1-1/2 cups).  Keep artichokes hot in a slow oven.

  Mix cornflour to a paste with a little cold water and stir into simmering
  liquid.  Stir until thickened and bubbling and leave to simmer gently.

  Beat eggs in a mixing bowl until light and frothy and gradually add
  remaining lemon juice.  Gradually pour in simmering stock, beating
  constantly.  Return to pan and stir over low heat for a minute or 2 to
  cook the egg.

  Pile artichokes on a warm platter, pour sauce on top and sprinkle with
  chopped dill.  Serve as a light meal or as a first course.

      Title: Cuttlefish With Spinach
 Categories: Greek, Seafood, Main dish
   Servings:  6

    750 g  Cuttlefish or squid
    1/3 c  Olive oil
           Water
           Salt
           Freshly ground black pepper
    750 g  Spinach
      1 c  Chopped spring onions
    1/2    Lemon (juice only)

  Cuttlefish (soupies) as distinct from squid (kalamaria) are preferred for
  this dish, though either may be used.  Cleaning cuttlefish can be a rather
  messy business as these marine molluscs have an ink sac from which the
  pigment sepia is obtained.  The sac ruptures easily and is usually
  ruptured by the time you purchase them, so don't be put off by their
  colour - the ink rinses off easily.

  Rinse cuttlefish or squid and remove head, attached tentacles and
  intestines; discard intestines.  Pull out cuttle bone or fine transparent
  bone if squid is being prepared.  Pull off fine skin and rinse.  Remove
  eyes and beak from head, leave head attached to tentacles and pull or rub
  off skin from tentacles, or as much skin as will easily come off.

  Slice hood or body into strips.  If squid are large, slice head and
  tentacles - cuttlefish tentacles are usually small and these are left
  intact.  Place prepared cuttlefish or squid in pan and set on medium heat.
  Cover and cook for 15 minutes in its own juice.  Add half the oil, just
  enough water to cover, and salt and pepper to taste, cover and simmer
  gently for 45 minutes or until tender.

  Meanwhile trim spinach and wash thoroughly.  Drain well and chop leaves
  and stalks coarsely.

  Heat remaining oil in a separate pan and gently fry spring onion until
  soft, add spinach and stir over heat until it wilts.  Add spinach mixture
  to cuttlefish or squid with lemon juice and adjust seasonings with salt
  and pepper.  Cover and simmer for further 10-15 minutes.  Serve hot.

      2 c  Short grain rice
    1/4 c  Chopped parsley
           Parsley sprigs, lemon wedges

  Serves: 6
  Cooking time: 45 minutes

  Scrub mussels with a stiff brush, scraping shells with a knife blade to
  clean them thoroughly.  Tug beard towards pointed end to remove.  Place in
  a bowl of lukewarm salted water until mussels open.  If any are open to
  begin with, tap shell - if mussel does not close, then discard it.  While
  mussels are open, run lukewarm water into the bowl so that any sand can be
  expelled from the mussels.  Drain.

  Heat oil and butter in a deep pan and add onion.  Fry gently until
  transparent.  Add mussels, cover pan and cook for 5 minutes until shells
  open.  If any do not open, then discard them.  Add 3 cups cold water,
  wine, 1 1/2 teaspoons salt and pepper to taste.  Cover pan and bring to a
  slow simmer.  Simmer gently for 10 minutes, then remove mussels with a
  slotted spoon.

  Wash rice until water runs clear, then add to liquid in pan with the
  parsley.  Bring to the boil, stirring occasionally.  Reduce heat, cover
  pan tightly and cook over low heat for 15 minutes.

  While rice is cooking scoop mussels from shells and reserve.  Keep 6
  mussels in the shell for garnish.  Put shelled mussels on top of rice.
  Place two paper towels over rim of pan and fit lid on firmly.  Leave on
  low heat for further 5 minutes, then remove pan to side of stove and leave
  for 10 minutes.

  Blend mussels through rice with a fork and pile pilafi in a dish.  Garnish
  with reserved mussels, parsley sprigs and lemon wedges.

  Note: 1/2 cup tomato puree (not paste) may replace 1/2 cup water for a
  different flavour.

   Servings: 20

      1    Baby lamb or kid, 10-12 kg
           Salt
           Freshly ground black pepper
      2    Lemons
    1/4 c  Butter; melted
    1/4 c  Olive oil
  2 1/2 kg Spinach
      3 c  Chopped spring onions
    3/4 c  Olive oil
      1 c  Short grain rice
  1 1/2 kg Feta cheese
    1/4 c  Chopped fresh dill
    1/4 c  Chopped fresh mint
           Salt
           Freshly ground black pepper

  Serves: 20
  Oven temperature: 180 C (350 F)
  Cooking time: 4-5 hours

  Wipe lamb inside and out with a damp cloth.  Rub cavity and outside of
  lamb with lemon juice, salt and pepper.  Cover and leave aside until
  stuffing is prepared.

  Trim roots from spinach and remove discoloured and damaged leaves.  Wash
  spinach in several changes of water, drain well and chop coarsely.

  In a large deep pan (not aluminium) gently fry spring onions in oil until
  soft, add spinach and stir over heat until it wilts.  Stir in washed rice,
  cover pan and cook on low heat for 10 minutes until most of liquid is
  absorbed.  Remove from heat and cool.  Break up feta into small chunks and
  add to spinach mixture with herbs.  Mix well, taste, then add salt if
  necessary and a generous grinding of pepper.  Blend thoroughly.

  Partly sew up the cavity with white string, pack stuffing in through
  opening and finish sewing up the cavity.  Push foreshanks back towards
  body and tie in postition, passing string over back of carcase.  Tie back
  legs, leaving them a little apart - tying will prevent them splaying
  outwards.  Rub outside again with lemon juice, salt and pepper and place
  on a rack set in a large catering-size baking dish.

  Combine melted butter with olive oil and brush half of this over the lamb
  or kid.  Cover dish with large sheets of foil, sealing joins with double
  folds.  Press foil under edges of dish to seal completely.

  Bake in a moderate oven for 4-5 hours.  After 2 hours lift foil and brush
  meat with butter-oil mixture.  Cook for further 1 1/2 to 2 hours, remove
  foil, brush again and cook uncovered for 30 minutes or until meat is
  cooked through and browned.  Remove from oven, cover with foil and a thick
  cloth and leave to rest for 30 minutes before carving.  Lift lamb or kid
  onto a large wooden board, remove string and spoon stuffing onto a
  platter.  Turn the carcase onto its back and chop along backbone from the
  inside with a cleaver.  Then chop each half into chunks and pile onto
  platters.  Meat on legs may be carved into slices.

  stiff, add egg yolks and continue beating until light and fluffy.  Add
  lemon juice gradually, beating constantly.  Gradually pour in boiling,
  thickened stock, beating constantly.  Return sauce to pan and cook,
  stirring constantly, over low heat for 1 to 2 minutes to cook the egg.  Do
  not allow sauce to boil.  Remove from heat and continue to stir for 1
  minute.  Season to taste.

  Pour Egg and Lemon Sauce over lamb and vegetable, cover and leave at the
  side of the stove for 5 minutes.  Arrange lamb and vegetable on a serving
  dish and sprinkle with chopped herb.  Serve immediately with crusty bread
  and a chilled white wine.

  8-12 small globe artichoke hearts.  Add to meat about 1 hour and cook for
  further 30-45 minutes.

  500 g (1 lb) celery stalks cut into 8 cm (3 inch) lengths and blanched in
  boiling, salted water for 5 minutes.  Drain, add to meat after 1 hour and
  cook for further 45 minutes.  Pork can be used instead of lamb with this
  vegetable.

  4 heads endive, washed well and trimmed of any coarse leaves.  Slit heads
  in half lengthways and blanch in boiling salted water for 2 minutes.
  Drain, add to meat after 1 1/2 hours and cook for further 15 minutes.

      Title: Arnaki Se Fillo (Lamb In Fillo)
 Categories: Greek, Meats, Main dish
   Servings:  6

      6    Boneless lamb leg steaks *
           Freshly ground black pepper
      2 tb Butter or oil
      2 md Onions; sliced
      1    Garlic clove
     12    Fillo sheets
    1/2 c  Butter; melted
           Salt
      3 md Tomatoes; peeled
      1 ts Rigani or oregano
    125 g  Feta cheese; cut in 6 slices

  *Note: Lamb steaks should be about 2 cm (3/4 inch) thick.

  Serves: 6
  Oven temperature: 200 C (400 F)
  Cooking time: 25-30 minutes

  Trim steaks of most of the fat and shape neatly - trimmings can be used in
  a ground lamb dish.  Season with pepper.

  Heat butter or oil in a frying pan and brown steaks quickly on each side -
  do not cook through.  Lift out onto a dish and leave until cool.  Add
  onions to pan and fry gently until transparent, add garlic and remove from
  heat.

  Brush a sheet of fillo pastry with melted butter and place another sheet
  on top, brushing again with butter.  Fold in half to make almost a square
  of fillo.  Put aside and cover wtih a dry tea towel, then one dampened
  with warm water.  Repeat with remaining fillo to give 6 prepared squares.
  Take one square and brush top with butter - leave remaining pastry
  covered.  Place a lamb steak in the centre and season lightly with salt.
  Top with onion-garlic mixture and cover with 2 slices of tomato.  Sprinkle
  with a little rigani, salt and pepper and place a slice of feta cheese on
  top.  Bring up ends of fillo pastry and double-fold over top.  Fold in
  ends as you would a package then tuck ends underneath.  This is known as a
  the chemist's (druggist's) fold.  Place on a buttered baking tray.  Repeat
  with remaining ingredients.

  Brush tops and sides of packages lightly with melted butter and bake in a
  preheated hot oven for 15 minutes.  Serve immediately if possible, though
  they will survive in the oven with heat turned off for about 10 minutes.
  Garnish with parsley sprigs and serve with boiled green beans or zucchini
  dressed with olive and lemon juice.

  Note:  Medallions of lamb cut from a trimmed loin can be used instead of
  the steaks.  You will require 12, and place 2 in each package.

  to a plate.

  Clean pan and add butter.  Melt over medium heat and add onion.  Fry
  gently until transparent.  Stir in parsley, fry 1 minute, then add tomato
  paste, water, wine and salt and pepper to taste.  Bring to a slow simmer.

  Return tripe to pan, cover and simmer gently for 2 hours or until tripe is
  tender.  To test for tenderness, take out a piece and pull.  If it breaks
  apart easily, tripe is cooked.

  Place in a serving dish, garnish with parsley and serve hot with pilaf and
  a tossed salad.

      1 lg Onion; finely chopped
      1 tb Olive oil
      1 kg Ground beef or lamb
    1/3 c  Short grain rice
      1    Tomato; peeled and chopped
      2 tb Chopped parsley
      1 ts Chopped dill or mint
    1/8 ts Ground cinnamon
           Freshly ground black pepper
     24    Cabbage leaves
           Salted water
      1 tb Butter
      2 c  Hot stock or water
           Salt
      1 tb Cornflour
      2    Eggs; separated
      1    Lemon (juice only)
           Chopped dill or parsley

  Serves: 6
  Cooking time: 1 1/2 hours

  Gently fry onion in oil until soft.  Mix into meat with rice, tomato,
  herbs and cinnamon, seasoning to taste with salt and pepper.  Divide into
  24 portions.

  Blanch cabbage leaves in boiling, salted water for 5 minutes until
  softened. Drain and cut out thick centre of larger leaves (very large
  leaves may be cut in half).  Place one portion of stuffing on base of
  leaf, turn up base, fold in sides and wrap firmly into a neat roll.
  Repeat with remaining ingredients.

  Place rolls close together, seam sides down, in a deep pan lined with
  trimmings from cabbage leaves.  Add stock or water, butter, salt and
  pepper to taste.  Invert a heavy plate on top of rolls and cover pan
  tightly.  Simmer gently for 1 1/2 hours.

  When cooked, drain off stock carefully into a small saucepan.  Reduce to 1
  1 1/2 cups over heat and thicken with cornflour mixed to a paste with a
  little cold water.  Let it boil 1 minute.

  Beat egg whites in a bowl until stiff, add yolks and beat thoroughly.
  Gradually beat in lemon juice, then boiling stock.  Return sauce to small
  pan, place over low heat and stir constantly until egg is cooked - do not
  boil.

  Arrange rolls on a heated serving dish and spoon some of the sauce over
  them.  Garnish with chopped dill or parsley and serve remaining sauce
  separately.   Serve with mashed potatoes.

  Note:  Grape vine leaves may be used instead of cabbage - about 40 will be
  required since they take less filling.

      Title: Kataifi me Krema (Shredded Pastry with Custard)
 Categories: Greek, Desserts
   Servings:  1

      4 c  Milk
    3/4 c  Cornflour
      4    Eggs; beaten
      1 pn Salt
    1/2 c  Sugar
      1 ts Vanilla essence
    500 g  Kataifi (shredded pastry)
    3/4 c  Unsalted butter; melted
      2 c  Sugar
  1 1/2 c  Water
      1    Thin strip lemon rind
      1    Piece of cinnamon bark
      3 ts Lemon juice

  Oven temperature: 190 C (375 F)
  Cooking time: 1 hour

  Combine milk and cornflour in a heavy pan.  Blend in beaten eggs and add
  salt and sugar.  Place over medium heat and stir constantly until
  thickened and bubbling.  Remove from heat, stir in vanilla essence and
  cover top of custard with buttered paper to prevent a skin forming.

  Place kataifi in a large bowl and gently separate strands with fingers.
  Grease a 20 x 28 cm (8 x 11 inch) oven dish with some of the butter.  Put
  half the kataifi in the base, pressing it down to make it compact.
  Drizzle 1/4 cup butterr evenly over it.  Pour custard filling over
  kataifi, spreading it evenly.  Top with remaining kataifi.  Spread evenly
  and pat down gently.  Pour remaining melted butter evenly over top.  Bake
  in a moderately hot oven for 45 minutes until golden brown.  Remove from
  oven and leave until cool.

  Dissolve sugar in water over medium heat, add lemon rind and cinnamon bark
  and bring to the boil.  Add lemon juice and boil over medium heat for 15
  minutes, skimming when necessary.  Do not stir once syrup is boiling.
  Strain hot syrup over cooled pastry.  Leave until cold and cut into
  diamond shapes to serve.

  Note: The previous recipe is the traditional way in which this dessert is
  made.  As the custard and syrup soften the kataifi, many good cooks use
  the following method for a crisp finish:

  Prepare the syrup as directed above and leave until cool.  Place the
  kataifi in a bowl and loosen stands.  Pour on 1/2 cup melted, unsalted
  butter and mix with fingers to coat strands.  Spread kataifi in two
  buttered 20 x 28 cm (8 x 11 inch) straight-sided oven dishes and press
  down to make it compact.  Bake in a moderately hot oven for 20-25 minutes
  until golden - take care that it does not become too brown.  Remove from
  the oven and pour cooled syrup evenly over hot kataifi in each dish.
  Cover each dish with a tea towel so that kataifi softens slightly,
  otherwise it will be difficult to cut.  Make custard as directed in
  previous recipe and pour while hot onto kataifi in one dish.  Invert other
  dish of kataifi on top of the custard.  Leave uncovered until cool, then
  cut into diamond shapes to serve.

      1 c  Caster sugar
      1 ts Vanilla essence
      3    Eggs
      5 c  Plain flour
      3 ts Baking powder
    1/2 ts Ground cinnamon
    1/4 ts Ground cloves
    1/4 c  Milk
    1/2 c  Toasted sesame seeds

  Makes: 70
  Cooking time: 15-20 minutes
  Oven temperature: 190 C (375 F)

  Cream butter and sugar with vanilla essence until light and fluffy.  Beat
  eggs, reserve 1 tablespoon for glazing and add remainder gradually to
  butter mixture, beating well.

  Sift dry ingredients twice.  Stir into creamed mixture alternately with
  milk to form a soft dough.  Knead lightly until smooth.  If dough is
  sticky, chill for 1 hour.

  Scatter some sesame seeds lightly on one side of pastry board.  Shape
  pieces of dough into thick pencil shapes and roll onto the sesame seeds to
  coat lightly or according to taste.  Double over rolled dough and twist,
  or form into rings, figure eights or coils.  Place on greased baking
  sheets and glaze with reserved egg beaten with a little milk.  Bake in a
  moderate oven for 15-20 minutes until golden brown.  Cool on a wire rack
  and store in an airtight container.

  Variation:  Roll dough in granulated sugar instead of seeds.  Glaze
  lightly with milk.

    500 g  Kataifi pastry
      1 c  Butter; melted
      1 c  Coarsely ground walnuts
      1 c  Coarsely ground almonds
    1/2 c  Caster sugar
      1 ts Ground cinnamon
    1/4 ts Ground cloves
      1    Egg white; lightly beaten
      1 tb Brandy
      2 c  Sugar
  1 1/2 c  Water
      1 ts Lemon juice
      1    Thin strip of lemon rind
      4    Cloves
      1    Piece cinnamon bark
      1 tb Honey

  Makes: 40 pieces
  Oven temperature: 180 C (350 F)
  Cooking time: 50-55 minutes

  Take an eighth of the pastry strands and spread out on a board to a 18 x
  25 cm (7 x 10 inch) rectangle with strands running roughly lengthwise.
  Using a pastry brush, dab some butter over strands.  Combine nut filling
  ingredients and spread about 2 tablespoons of filling along one narrow
  edge.  Roll up firmly into a neat roll.  Repeat with remaining
  ingredients.  Place rolls close together in a 20 x 30 cm (8 x 12 inch)
  slab cake pan or baking dish.  Brush top with remaining butter.  Bake in a
  moderate oven, one shelf above centre, for 50-55 minutes until golden
  brown.

  Meanwhile, dissolve sugar in water over heat, add lemon juice and rind,
  cloves and cinnamon.  Bring to the boil and boil over medium heat for 10
  minutes.  Stir in honey, strain and cool.  Pour cooled syrup over hot
  pastries and place a folded cloth on top.  Leave until cool.  Cut each
  roll into 5 pieces diagonally if preferred.

  ALTERNATIVE SHAPING:  Take a small handful of pastry strands and spread
  out fairly compactly on board.  Have strands running towards you as much
  as possible and dab with butter.  Mould a tablespoon of nut filling into a
  short sausage shape and place on one end.  Roll up firmly into a neat roll
  and place in baking dish.  Repeat with remaining ingredients.  Makes about
  30 rolls each about 5 cm (2 inches) long.  Bake as directed above, prepare
  syrup and finish as in previous recipe.

    3/4 c  Caster sugar
  4 1/2 c  Plain flour
    1/4 ts Salt
    1/2 ts Ground cinnamon
    1/4 ts Ground masticha
    1/2 c  Butter; melted
      1    Egg; for glazing
           Blanched split almonds

  New Year Bread is traditionally cut at midnight on New Year's Eve.  After
  baking, a coin is inserted through a slit in the base.  The person who
  finds the coin will have luck in the New Year.  Long ago the coin used to
  be a gold one, then later a silver coin was used.  These could be
  incorporated into the dough before baking.  Nowadays because of the nickel
  content of coins it is undesirable to bake a coin in the cake.

  Dissolve yeast in 1/4 cup of the milk.  Add remainder of milk, eggs,
  orange rind and sugar.  Sift 3 cups flour, salt and spice into a warm bowl
  and make a well in the centre.  Pour in yeast mixture and stir to blend in
  flour, gradually adding warm melted butter.  Mix dough with hands until it
  comes away from sides.  Turn on to a floured surface and knead until
  smooth and elastic, adding remaining flour as required.  Knead for 10
  minutes.  Place ball of dough in a clean bowl brushed with melted butter.
  Turn dough over to coat top with butter and cover bowl with a cloth or
  plastic wrap.  Leav to prove (rise) in a warm place until doubled in bulk.
  Punch down and turn on to lightly floured surface.  Knead lightly and
  shape into a round loaf.  Place on a large greased baking sheet or in a
  greased 25 cm (10 inch) deep cake tin.  Cover and let rise in a warm place
  until doubled - about 1 1/2 to 2 hours.

  Glaze with well-beaten egg and arrange blanched almonds in numbers to
  denote the New Year, pressing in lightly.  Bake in a moderately hot oven
  for 45 minutes until golden brown and cooked when tested.  If bread browns
  too quickly place a piece of greased brown paper on top.  Cool on a wire
  rack.

      Title: Kythoni Peltes (Quince Jelly)
 Categories: Greek, Jam/jelly
   Servings:  1

      1 kg Quinces
      4 c  Water
           Granulated sugar
      2 ts Lemon juice
      2    Rose geranium leaves

  Cooking time: 2 hours

  Wash quinces well to remove the fuzz.  Peel and core.  Slice quinces into
  preserving pan and add 2 cups water.  Leave aside and do not be concerned
  if quince discolours.

  Place peels and cores into a pan with remaining water and boil for 30
  minutes.  Strain and make liquid up to 2 cups with water.  Add liquid from
  peels to sliced quinces in pan.  Bring to the boil and simmer gently for 1
  hour until quince flesh is very tender.

  Scald a large piece of cheese cloth or doubled butter muslin, wring out
  and drape over a deep bowl.  Pour quince and liquid into clean cloth and
  gather up ends.  Tie with string and suspend over bowl.  Secure to a fixed
  object so that juice can drip slowly into bowl.  Leave for 24 hours.  Do
  not squeeze bag to hasten dripping as this will make jelly cloudy.
  Measure juice into clean preserving pan.  For each cup of juice add 1 cup
  sugar.  Stir over heat till sugar dissolves, add lemon juice and washed
  geranium leaves and bring to the boil.

  Boil rapidly for 25 minutes, skimming frequently.  Test a teaspoonful on a
  cold saucer.  Leave to cool.  Run finger across jelly in saucer - setting
  point is reached when surface wrinkles.  It is advisable to remove pan
  from heat while jelly is being tested as you would overcook the jelly.
  Remove leaves and ladle hot jelly into hot sterilized jars.  Seal when
  cold.

  cold saucer.

  Stir in almonds and lemon juice and boil 1 minute longer.  Ladle into hot,
  sterilized jars and seal when cold.

  Note:  As the peel and core contain pectin, the setting ingredients for
  jellies and preserves, it is advisable that these be boiled to extract the
  pectin.

      Title: Baklava with Cream Filling (Muhallebili Baklava)
 Categories: Turkish, Greek, Desserts
   Servings: 24

      1 lb Phyllo pastry sheets
    3/4 lb Sweet butter; melted
      3 c  Milk
    1/3 c  Sugar
    1/4 ts Salt
    1/2 c  Fine grain semolina
  2 2/3 c  Sugar
      2 c  Water
      2 tb Lemon juice

  Preheat oven to 350 F after the filling has been prepared.

  Divide the pastry into 2-equal parts.  Lay 1 sheet on a well-buttered 11 x
  16 inch baking pan.  Brush surface generously with melted butter.  Lay
  second sheet on top of first and butter.  Repeat until half of the pastry
  sheets have been used.

  Cover unused half of pastry sheets with a kitchen cloth to prevent drying.

  Prepare the filling:  Over medium heat bring milk, sugar and salt to a
  boil in a saucepan.  Add farina by sprinkling in a little at a time,
  stirring constantly until the mixture thickens and the farina is well
  cooked.

  Spread the hot farina mixture evenly over the entire surface of pastry
  sheets.  Again build up the remaining half of the pastry sheets, buttering
  each surface generously, on top of farina.  Pour the remaining butter over
  the top.  Cut pastry sheets into 24 equal squares.  Bake for 40 to 45
  minutes or until light golden.

  While the baklava is cooking prepare syrup:  Place sugar, water, and lemon
  juice in a saucepan.  Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, until
  sugar is dissolved.  Bring to a boil and simer for 15 minutes without
  stirring.  Remove from heat and allow to cool.

  Remove baklava from oven.  Pour off all excess butter by tilting the pan.
  Cook for 10 minutes.  Brush surface lightly with some of the drained
  butter to give luster to the pastry.  Pour syrup over a little at a time,
  until all is absorbed.  Allow to cool for several hours.

      1 lb Phyllo pastry sheets
  1 1/2 c  Sweet butter; melted

  *Note: Either toasted blanched almonds, or walnut meats, or half of each,

  Cooky Filling:  Cream the 2 cups sweet butter until light.  Gradually beat
  in the confectioners' sugar and continue to beat until mixture is fluffy.
  Add egg yolk and vanilla or almond extract and blend well.  Work in about
  4 cups flour to make a medium-soft dough.  Set aside and make syrup.

  Syrup:  In a saucepan combine the granulated sugar and water.  Bring to a
  boil and boil for 15 minutes or until syrup is slightly thick.  Add honey
  and again bring to the boiling point.  Add lemon juice to taste, and cool.

  phyllo on top and sprinkle with nut mixture.  Shape a portion of cooky
  filling into a 1/2-inch-thick roll and place the roll along one edge of
  the pastry sheets.  Roll up loosely, cut into 2-inch slices, and place
  slices in a buttered cake pan.  (Continue in this method until all phyllo
  pastry and/or cooky filling is used.)  Brush tops of each slice with
  butter and bake in a 350 F oven for 20 minutes or until lightly browned.
  Dip the hot baklava slices, one at a time, in cold syrup, allowing each
  piece to remain in the syrup for a few minutes.

      Title: Kythonopasto (Quince Paste)
 Categories: Greek, Desserts
   Servings:  1

           Pulp from Kythoni Peltes
           Granulated sugar
           Water
           Bay leaves
           Caster sugar

  Cooking time: 45-50 minutes.

  Puree quince pulp by pressing through a sieve or process in food
  processor.  Measure puree into a heavy pan.  Add 1 cup sugar and 1/4 cup
  water to each cup of pulp.  Set over medium heat and stir occasionally
  until sugar is dissolved.

  Bring to the boil, then boil steadily for 40-45 minutes, stirring
  occasionally so that paste cooks evenly.  As paste is thick, it has a
  tendency to scorch, so watch carefully.

  When cooked, paste comes away from sides of pan and is dark red in colour.
  Spread while hot into an oiled slab cake pan so that it is 2 cm (3/4 inch)
  thick.  Leave in pan at room temperature for 2-3 days, lightly covered
  with muslin.

  When dry and firm, cut into small diamond shapes with an oiled knife.
  Lift out and place in a container with bay leaves between layers.  Seal
  tightly.

  When serving, dip tops lightly into caster sugar to give pieces a fine
  coating.  Kythonopasto keeps indefinitely stored at room temperature and
  is traditionally served in place of a spoon sweet, accompanied with a
  glass of iced water.

  greased baking dish with bread crumbs.  Alternate layers of vegetables and
  meat in the pan, sprinkling each layer with cheese.  The top layer should
  be vegetables.  Dot with 1 tablespoon butter and add water. Set aside.

  In saucepan melt remaining 6 tablespoons butter.  Add flour and cook,
  stirring, until well mixed and beginning to brown.  Slowly stir in milk and
  cook, stirring, until sauce is smooth and thickened.  Beat eggs with a
  little of the hot sauce, then stir in to remaining sauce.  Remove from
  heat.  Pour a little more than half the sauce over the vegetables and bake
  in a 350 F oven for 10 minutes.  Meanwhile return remaining sauce to low
  heat and cook, stirring, until thick.  Pour into casserole and sprinkle
  with cheese.  Continue to bake for 45 to 50 minutes longer or until golden
  brown.

      Title: Skorthalia - Garlic Sauce (Greek Cookbook)
 Categories: Greek, Sauces
   Servings:  4

      6    Garlic cloves
           Salt
      1 c  Mashed potatoes
      2 sl Stale white bread
    1/3 c  Olive oil
      1 tb Lemon juice
      1 tb Vinegar
           Pepper

  Pound garlic with 1/2 teaspoon salt in a mortar until smooth.  Add mashed
  potatoes and continue to pound and stir with pestle.  Soak bread (crusts
  removed) in cold water and squeeze dry.  Add to potatoes and garlic,
  pounding and stirring until smooth.  Gradually add olive oil, lemon juice
  and vinegar, stirring vigorously.  When smooth and light, add salt and
  pepper to taste.  Chill in a covered bowl before using.

  Serve with hot or cold seafoods and fried or boiled vegetables.

  Variation: Replace bread with 1/2 cup ground almonds or walnuts, or use
  1-1/2 cups ground almonds or walnuts instead of the potatoes and bread.

  Blender method:  Put all ingredients in jar of blender and blend at
  moderate speed until ingredients are pulverised.  Increase speed for a few
  seconds until light and smooth.  Do not blend too long at high speed for
  the mixture heats and the oil separates.

      Title: Astakos Plaki - Lobster in Tomato Sauce with Saffron Rice
 Categories: Greek, Seafood
   Servings:  4

      2    Lobsters (about 2 lbs each) (live, or recently dead)
     25    Saffron strands; soaked in
    1/4 c  Hot water
    1/4 lb Finely chopped onion
      1 md Leek; washed, finely chopped
      8 tb Fruity olive oil
      3    Garlic cloves; minced
      1 lb Tomatoes; skinned, seeded,
           - and finely chopped
      4    Sun-dried tomatoes (in oil)
           - pounded to a paste
    1/2 c  White wine
    1/4 c  Orange juice
      1    Bay leaf
           Salt & freshly ground Pepper
    1/2 c  Finely chopped Fennel
    1/2 c  Minced flat-leaf Parsley
      1 tb Finely chopped fresh Mint
           Saffron Rice

  If you have live lobsters, plunge them into a pan of boiling water for 1
  minute, then into cold water.

  To prepare the lobsters, break off the claws and crack them open with a
  hammer.  Cut off the tip of the tail (with the fins), then sever the tail
  where it joins the head with a heavy knife.  Cut the tail into rings,
  slicing through the shell between the ribs.

  Split the head open lengthwise with a hard blow of a knife and remove and
  discard the gritty stomach sac.  Pour the coral (if any) and the green
  matter (which is the liver) into a stainer over a bowl, sprinkle with salt
  and pepper, and reserve.  Put the saffron to soak.

  In a heavy-bottomed pan big-enough to contain the lobsters and sauce, fry
  the onion and leek gently in 3 tablespoons olive oil until translucent.
  Add the garlic, chopped tomatoes, tomato paste and liquid, wine, orange
  juice, and bay leaf.  Season and simmer, covered, for 15 minutes.

  Add the fennel, parsley, mint, saffron and liquid, and lobster tail pieces
  and claws with their shells (but not the legs) and simmer, covered, for 10
  minutes.

  In the meantime push the coral and liver of the lobster through the
  strainer and beat the pur�e with the remaining olive oil.  When the
  lobster has simmered for 10 minutes, ladle out about 1 cup sauce and beat
  this into the coral pur�e.  Pour this back into the pot, stir, and simmer
  for another 10 minutes.  Serve with saffron rice.

      Title: Saffron Rice
 Categories: Greek, Side dish
   Servings:  4

     25    Saffron strands
    1/2 c  Hot water
      2 tb Olive oil
  1 1/2 c  Basmati rice
  2 1/2 c  Water
           Salt; to taste

  Soak the saffron in the hot water for 10-15 minutes.  Put the rice in a
  strainer and rinse under hot water until it runs clear.  Then rinse again
  under cold water and leave to drain.

  Heat the oil in a saucepan and add the rice.  Saut� until it becomes
  translucent.  Add the remaining amount of water and salt, bring to a boil,
  and add the saffron infusion.  Stir, cover tightly, and leave to simmer on
  a very low heat (preferably on a heat diffuser) - for about 20 minutes,
  until craters from on the surface.

  Stretch a piece of cheesecloth or a dish towel over the top, cover tightly
  with a lid, and leave in a warm corner to rest for 10-15 minutes. The
  cloth will absorb the steam from the rice and allow the grains to
  separate.

      Title: Anginares Tarama
 Categories: Greek, Appetizers, Vegetables
   Servings:  6

      6 sm Fresh globe artichokes
  1 1/2 oz Tarama; rinsed if necessary
      2 oz -Smoked skinned cod's roe
      1 tb Finely grated onion pulp
      2 lg Juicy lemons
      1 c  Fruity olive oil
           Salt
           Freshly ground white pepper

  To clean the artichokes, cut off the stems flush with the base, remove any
  tough, unsightly outer leaves and cut off the top one-third of the flower
  bud itself.  Force the leaves open a little, and rinse under cold water,
  with a squeeze of lemon or a splash of vinegar to prevent discoloring.

  Place the artichokes upside-down in a pot large enough to hold them all in
  one layer and pour in boiling water to come one-fourth of the way up the
  sides.  Salt and simmer 15-40 minutes, depending on their age and size -
  until the heart is just tender when pricked with a fork.  Drain and
  refresh them under cold water; drain again and chill.

  Beat the tarama or smoked cod's roe with the grated onion.  You can do
  this easily in a food processor.  Finely grate the zest of one lemon and
  beat in, with 2 teaspoons boiling water.

  Squeeze the juice of both lemons.  Alternately dribble in lemon juice and
  olive oil, beating each addition in before adding the next, as though
  making mayonnaise - it may not need all the oil.  If you are doing this by
  hand, it take perseverence and elbow grease to make it nice and light.
  Taste and season with pepper.  Open the artichokes and remove the inner,
  soft leaves and then the hairy choke.  Spoon tarama into the cup of
  leaves.

      Title: Christopsomo tis Kirias Zinis
 Categories: Greek, Breads, Holiday
   Servings:  3

  4 1/2 c  Semolina flour
  2 1/4 c  Sugar
      3 tb Freshly ground cinnamon
      1 tb Freshly ground anise
      1 tb Freshly ground coriander
      2 ts Freshly ground cloves
      3    Oranges
      6    Tangerines
  2 1/2 c  Dried currants
      1 c  Golden raisins
      1 c  Olive oil, mild
      4 pk Active dry yeast
    1/2 ts Sugar
    1/2 c  -Hot water, just above body
           - temperature
      4 c  All-purpose flour;
           -plus extra for kneading

  Make the flavoring addition first.  Combine the semolina flour, sugar,
  cinnamon, anise, coriander, and cloves in a bowl and add the finely grated
  zests of the oranges and tangerines.  Squeeze some of the oranges and
  tangerines.  Squeeze some of the oranges and tangerines to obtain 1 1/4
  cups juice.  Use half this juice to soak the currants and raisins for a
  minimum of 1 hour, preferably overnight.  Put the remaining juice in a pan
  with the olive oil.  Heat until almost boiling.  Pour this into a bowl
  with the semolina and spice mixture and stir.  Cover and leave overnight
  until needed.

  Next day, combine the dried yeast with the sugar and hot water in a cup.
  Put the flour in a bowl, making a well in the center.  Pour in the yeast
  mixture.  Squeeze 2/3 cup more orange and tangerine juice, warm it, nad
  add.  Work to a smooth dough, adding more water and warm juice if
  necessary.  Put the dough into an oiled bowl, cover with a cloth, and
  leave to rise in a warm place until almost doubled in size - about an
  hour.

  Punch down the dough in a bowl.  Combine the drained currants and raisins
  with the semolina and spice mixture and, working with your hands, combine
  with the dough.  Turn the dough onto a floured surface and knead for 10
  minutes, adding more flour if the dough is sticky.

  Divide the dough into three equal pieces.  Oil 3 loaf pans, each 1-1/2
  quart capacity.  Shape each piece to fit the length of the pan and fit
  them in, so the corners are well filled.  Cover with a cloth and leave to
  rise in a warm place until almost double in size - another hour.

  Bake in an oven preheated to 350 F for 1 hour and 10 minutes or more; the
  loaves should be rich brown color and make a hollow sound when the
  unmolded bread is thumped on the bottom.  Leave on a rack to cool.  The
  bread will keep for at least 3 weeks.

      Title: Portokalia se Mavrothaphne - Oranges in Red Wine
 Categories: Desserts, Fruits
   Servings:  6

      8    Navel oranges
    1/2 c  Sugar
      2 c  Mavrodaphne or ruby port
      1    Bay leaf
      1    Clove

  Remove the zest of 2 of the oranges with a zester; or pare finely with a
  vegetable peeler, then cut into thin julienne strips.  With a very sharp
  knife, cut off the skin and outside membrane of all the oranges, so you
  have glistening orbs of golden pulp.  Do this over a bowl to catch
  escaping juice.

  Choose a saucepan just large enough to hold 2 oranges at a time and put in
  the escaped juice and remaining ingredients.  Dissolve the sugar and
  simmer for 5 minutes.  Submerge 2 oranges at a time and cook just long
  enough to warm them through - about 3 minutes.  If they bob up, place a
  small weighted saucer over them.  Remove to a serving dish and continue
  with the next pair until finished.

  Boil to reduce the syrup by half, drizzle over the oranges, and chill.

      Title: Fava Bean Salata
 Categories: Greek, Salads
   Servings:  8

  1 1/2 c  Dried fava or butter beans; soaked overnight in water
    1/3 c  Extra-virgin olive oil
    1/2 c  Finely chopped onion
      1    Garlic clove; finely chopped
    1/3 c  Finely diced carrot
    1/3 c  Finely diced celery
      1    Bay leaf; crumbled
  2 1/2 tb Minced flat-leaf parsley
           Sea salt; to taste
    1/2 ts Freshly ground black pepper
      1 sl Coarse-grain bread
      2 tb Olive oil; (or to taste)
      1 sm Lemon; juiced
      1 pn Paprika; (generous)

  Drain the dried beans and place in large saucepan with cold water to
  cover.  Bring slowly to a boil, drain and rinse.  Rinse out the saucepan,
  return the beans to the pan, and add cold water to cover by 3 inches.
  Bring to a boil, reduce the heat, cover, and gently simmer 25 to 30
  minutes, or until soft.  Drain, reserving 1/2 cup of the cooking liquid.
  Remove the fava bean skins with your fingers and spread the beans between
  layers of paper towels to dry.

  Heat 2 tablespoons of the olive oil in a large heavy skillet.  Saute the
  onion, garlic, carrot, celery, and bay leaf over medium-low heat for 15 to
  20 minutes, or until dark golden brown, stirring occasionally with a
  wooden spoon.

  Transfer to a food processor or blender container and add the bread.  With
  the machine running, add about two thirds of the lemon juice and 2
  tablespoons of the olive oil, and process until thick and smooth.  Add a
  few tablespoons of water if the puree seems too thick, and add salt,
  pepper, olive oil, and/or lemon juice to taste.

  Serve on a platter, sprinkled with the remaining parsley and olive oil and
  the paprika.

  To make the traditional way:  Pound the cooked vegetable-bean mixture and
  the bread in a large wooden mortar for 5 minutes.  Slowly add about two
  thirds of the lemon juice and then 3/4 cup of the olive oil.  Pound for 5
  minutes longer, and add salt, pepper, olive oil, and/or lemon juice to
  taste.

      Title: Lamb Phyllo Rolls
 Categories: Greek, Main dish
   Servings:  6

      5 tb Extra-virgin olive oil
      6 tb Unsalted butter
      1 lg Onion; finely chopped
  1 1/2 lb Lean lamb, finely ground
      2 lg Ripe tomatoes; peeled, diced
      1 ts Honey
      1 tb Ground cinnamon; OR to taste
    1/2 ts Sea salt; OR to taste
      1 ts Cracked black pepper
    1/4 c  Reduced meat stock
  1 1/2 tb Minced flat-leaf parsley
      1 c  Fresh myzithra cheese;
    1/3 c  Finely grated feta cheese
    1/2 ts Grated nutmeg
      2    Egg yolks
     12    Phyllo sheets
           Confectioners' sugar
           Ground cinnamon

  Warm 1 tablespoon of the olive oil and 2 tablespoons of the butter in a
  heavy skillet and saute the onion over low heat until soft, about 8
  minutes.  Raise the heat, add the meat, and saute until lightly browned,
  breaking up any lumps with a wooden spoon.  Add the tomatoes, honey,
  cinnamon, salt, and 1/2 teaspoon of the pepper, and bring to a boil.  Add
  the stock, bring to a boil, reduce the heat, and simmer 15 minutes, or
  until almost all the liquid has evaporated.  Add the marjoram and parsley,
  and additional cinnamon, marjoram, and pepper to taste (do not add salt at
  this point, as the cheese mixture is salty).  Set aside, or refrigerate
  for up to 24 hours.

  Heat the oven to 375 F.  Press the myzithra through a sieve or food mill
  into a bowl.  Combine with the feta, nutmeg, remaining 1/2 teaspoon
  pepper, and the egg yolks, cover and set aside.

  Combine the remaining 4 tablespoons butter and olive oil in a small
  saucepan, and melt over very low heat.  Brush a heavy baking sheet with
  some of this mixture.  Lay the phyllo sheets one on top of another and cut
  in half crosswise to make 24 sheets.  Tightly rewrap half the sheets and
  refrigerate.  Lay 1 of the remaining sheets on a clean work surface, with
  a long end facing you, and brush lightly with the butter mixture.  Lay a
  second sheet on top, brush it with the mixture, and repeat with a third
  sheet.  Lay another sheet on top.  Divide the meat mixture into 6
  portions.  Place 1 portion on the bottom third of the top phyllo sheet and
  shape it into a sausage about 8 inches long.  Divide the cheese filling
  into 6 portions and spread 1 portion over the meat.  Fold the bottom edges
  of the phyllo layers over the filling, then fold over the 2 sides, and
  roll up to make a firm neat parcel.  Place on the baking sheet and repeat
  with the remaining phyllo and filling.

  Brush the rolls with the remaining butter mixture and bake 25 to 30
  minutes, or until deep golden brown.  Drain on paper towels, sprinkle

      Title: Rigani Cheese Bread
 Categories: Breads, Greek
   Servings: 12

      1 tb Active dry yeast
      1 c  -Tepid (110 F) water
      3 tb Olive oil
    1/2 ts Fine-grain sea salt
      3 c  Whole wheat flour, or more
      2 tb Dried rigani; crumbled
    1/2 tb Dried mint; finely crumbled
    3/4 lb Feta cheese; well drained, finely crumbled
      1    Egg yolk; beaten with:
      2 tb -Warm water

  Sprinkle the yeast over the water and set aside in a warm place until
  foamy, about 10 minutes.  Whisk in 2 tablespoons of the olive oil and the
  salt.

  Sift the flour into a large mixing bowl, make a well in the center, and
  pour in the yeast mixture.  Knead 10 minutes, adding additional flour if
  necessary to make a firm elastic dough.  Transfer to a lightly oiled bowl,
  tightly cover with plastic wrap, and set aside for 2 hours in a warm
  draft-free spot.

  Knead in the rigani, mint, and feta until evenly distributed throughout
  the dough.  Lightly oil a heavy baking sheet and place the dough in the
  center.  Form into a round loaf and flatten to a thickness of 2 inches.
  Cover with a clean kitchen towel and set aside for 1 hour in a warm
  draft-free spot.  The dough will rise only slightly.

  Heat the oven to 350 F.

  With a sharp thin blade, slash the top of the loaf diagonally in 2 or 3
  parallel lines, brush with the remaining olive oil, and bake 25 minutes.
  Brush with the beaten egg yolk and bake 15 minutes longer, or until the
  bread is deep golden brown and sounds hollow when tapped on the bottom.

      Title: Kos Lemon Pie
 Categories: Greek, Pies, Desserts
   Servings: 12

      1 c  Unbleached all-purpose flour
    1/4 c  Confectioners' sugar
    1/2 tb Finely grated lemon peel
      1 pn Salt
      8 tb Unsalted butter
           - cut into small pieces
      2    Egg yolks
      1 ts Vanilla extract
      8 tb Unsalted butter at room temperature
    1/3 c  Honey
      5    Egg yolks
  1 1/2 c  Ground blanched almonds
      2    Lemons; juiced
    1/4 c  Heavy cream
    1/2 c  Superfine sugar
    1/2 c  -Water
      1    Lemon; juiced
           Confectioners' sugar; sifted

  To make the pastry, sift the flour and confectioners' sugar into a large
  cold bowl, stir in the grated lemon zest and salt, and add the butter.
  Quickly and lightly rub the mixture together with your fingers until it
  resembles coarse meal.  Beat the egg yolks and vanilla together and stir
  into the flour mixture.  Pull the dough together into a ball with your
  fingers, adding cold water only if necessary to make a soft dough.
  Tightly cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 30 minutes.

  Set a rack in the center of the oven and heat the oven to 375 F.

  Lightly flour a work surface and roll out the pastry to fit a 9- to
  10-inch tart pan with a removable bottom.  To transfer the pastry, wrap it
  around the rolling pin, lift above the pan, and unroll over the rim.  With
  your thumb and knuckle, gently press the pastry into the pan, then roll
  the rolling pin over the rim to trim the edges.  Line with aluminum foil
  and bake 6 to 8 minutes or until just set.  Set aside, and lower the oven
  temperature to 325 F.

  To make the filling, beat the butter and honey with an electric mixer or
  by hand until pale and creamy.  Beat in the egg yolks one at a time.  Then
  stir in the almonds, the juice of 2 lemons (reserve the zest, removed in
  thin strips), and the cream.  Pour into the pastry shell and lightly smooth
  the top with a spatula.  Bake 30 to 40 minutes, or until golden brown and
  set.

  Meanwhile, combine the superfine sugar, reserved lemon zest, and water in
  a sugar pan or small heavy saucepan.  Slowly bring to a boil, then simmer
  6 minutes or until the syrup lightly coats the back of a metal spoon.  Set
  aside to cool slightly.

  Add the remaining lemon juice to the barely warm syrup and strain,
  reserving the zest.  Pour the syrup over the warm pie, remove from the
  pan, and liberally sprinkle with confectioners' sugar and the reserved
  zest.  Serve immediately.

  Note: To make the pastry in the food processor, chill the processor bowl
  and metal blade in the refrigerator for 1 hour.  Working very quickly,
  process the flour, sugar, lemon zest, and butter until the mixture
  resembles coarse meal.  Add the egg yolks and vanilla and pulse just to
  mix.  (It is unlikely that you will need to add water.)  Wrap and
  refrigerate.

    2/3 c  Round or short-grain rice
      3 c  Milk
    1/3 c  Superfine or vanilla sugar
      1 tb Superfine or vanilla sugar
      1    1/2" strip of orange zest
      1 pn Salt
      1 tb Unsalted butter
      1    Egg
    1/2 ts Vanilla extract; or to taste
      1 tb Fresh lemon juice
    1/3 c  Rich Cream (w/o crust);
    1/2 c  -Heavy cream
           Ground cinnamon
           Confectioners' sugar; sifted

  Place the rice in boiling water and leave for 5 seconds; drain, and rinse.
  Bring the milk almost to a boil in a heavy saucepan, and stir in the rice,
  the first quantity of sugar, the orange zest, salt, and butter.  Reduce
  the heat to very low and simmer uncovered, stirring occasionally to
  prevent sticking, for 1 hour, or until thick and creamy.  Remove from the
  heat and set aside.

  Whisk together the egg, vanilla, lemon juice, and remaining sugar until
  pale and thick, about 2 minutes.  Remove the orange zest from the rice
  mixture and stir half the rice into the egg mixture.  Return this to the
  saucepan and stir to combine.  Gently cook over low heat, stirring well,
  for 2 minutes.  Stir in the Rich Cream and add more sugar or lemon juice
  if desired.  (If using heavy cream, beat until slightly thickened, then
  stir into the rice mixture.)   Divide among individual dishes and chill.

  To serve, liberally dust with the cinnamon and confectioners' sugar.

      Title: Rich Cream - Kaymaki
 Categories: Greek
   Servings:  1

      1 qt Heavy cream

  Thick rich eastern Mediterranean "kaymaki" (literally, "frothy cream") is
  unique, but two more readily available products have a similar flavor and
  texture.  Imported English clotted (Devon) cream and Italian mascarpone
  cheese both make good substitutes, or you cna make your own.  Make this
  when you plan to be in the kitchen for a couple of hours - for an even
  smooth texture and a thick crust you need to stir the hot cream at regular
  intervals.  Be sure to use meticulously clean utensils and keep the
  cooking heat very low (or use a heat diffuser mat).  Kaymaki should be
  made at least 18 hours before you need it; it can be stored for up to a
  week.

  Slowly bring the cream almost to a boil in a heavy saucepan, stirring
  occasionally with a wooden spoon.  Reduce the heat to as low as possible,
  or place the saucepan on a heat diffuser mat.  Lift a ladleful of cream
  about 12 inches above the saucepan, and pour it back in a thin steady
  stream; repeat 2 or 3 times.  Repeat this procedure every 10 minutes or so
  over the next 1-1/2 hours, and stir the cream occasionally to make sure
  it does not stick.

  Leave the cream undisturbed over the lowest heat for 30 minutes longer; it
  will have reduced by at least two thirds.  Remove the saucepan from the
  heat and let cool.

  Loosely cover with a clean kitchen towel and set aside for 2 hours.

  Remove the kitchen towel, tightly cover, and refrigerate for at least 12
  hours, or overnight.

  Cut the crust on top of the cream into 1-inch-wide strips.  Gently fold
  one end of a strip over the handle of a wooden spoon and roll it up (cut
  in half if the roll becomes too thick or unwieldy), and slide off onto a
  plate.  Repeat with the remaining strips.  The remaining kaymaki will have
  the texture of thick airless cream.  It can be refrigerated in a tightly
  covered container of up to 1 week; refrigerate the rolls for up to 3 days.

  Note: Serve kaymaki rolls on their own or with desserts such as Kataifi
  Nut Rolls or Almond Cake.  Kaymaki cream can be added to ice cream or rice
  pudding for an especially good flavor.  Or whisk it together with a little
  sweet wine or lemon juice for a perfect accompaniment to fresh or poached
  fruit or sweet pastries.

      Title: Psari Spetsiotiko - Fish, Spetsai style
 Categories: Greek, Fish, Seafood
   Servings:  4

      2 lb Fish
      1    Lemon; juiced
           Salt
    1/3 c  Olive oil
      4    Ripe tomatoes
    1/4 c  White wine
      4    Garlic cloves; sliced
    1/2 ts Granulated sugar
           Salt
           Freshly ground black pepper
      1 c  Chopped fresh parsley
           Bread crumbs
           Tomato juice, if necessary

  Wash and dry the fish (if using dried cod be sure it was soaked
  overnight), then sprinkle with salt and lemon juice, particulary inside
  the neck area if using fish with heads on.  Arrange on a baking-serving
  dish and set aside while you prepare the sauce.

  Heat the oil in a saucepan, add the tomatoes, wine, garlic, and sugar and
  simmer for 10 to 15 minutes.  (The amount of garlic may be reduced, but it
  *IS* the most important ingredient.)  Season with salt and pepper.

  Sprinkle the fish with a light coating of bread crumbs and then with the
  chopped parsley, then spoon the hot sauce over the fish.  Repeat the
  procedure until all the sauce has been used, ending with a topping of
  bread crumbs.  Bake in a moderate oven (350 F) for 30 to 40 minutes,
  depending on the size of the fish, basting twice with the sauce.  (A
  golden crust will form on the fish, characteristic of this famous style.)
  During the baking period, add some wie or tomato juice if necessary; some
  sauce should remain around the fish.  Serve hot.

  NOTE: This makes an excellent first course with dry white Demesticha or
  Samos wine.

      Title: Roulo me Filo
 Categories: Greek, Meats, Main dish
   Servings:  4

      2 tb Butter or margarine
      1 sm Shallot or onion
  1 1/2 lb Veal, ground
    1/2 c  Chopped tomatoes
      1    Cinnamon stick;
      1 ts -Ground Cinnamon
           Salt; if necessary
           Freshly ground black pepper
      1 ts Chopped fresh basil
      2    Eggs; separated
  1 1/2 c  Thick Saltsa Aspri
    1/2 c  Grated mizithra cheese
    1/2 ts Grated nutmeg
           Heavy greaseproof paper
     12    Filo pastry sheets
    1/3 c  Butter or margarine
      2    Eggs, hard-cooked; sliced
      1 tb Chopped fresh parsley

  Heat the butter in a large frying pan, then saute the onion until soft.
  Add the meat, mashing it with a fork until the raw color disappears.  Add
  the tomato and cinnamon, cover and simmer about 20 minutes, stirring once
  or twice.  Remove the lid and season judiciously (if the cheese is salty,
  don't add salt until the very end).  Stir in the basil, then remove the
  cinnamon stick and cool.  Using a wooden spoon, mix the egg whites into
  the meat.  Meanwhile, prepare the saltsa aspri (it must be thick) and
  combine with the egg yolks, cheese, and nutmeg.  Taste to see if salt is
  needed.

  To make the loaf, spread the baking paper flat on your work surface.  Lay
  a sheet of filo (keeping the rest covered with a damp towel or waxed
  paper) in the center of the paper and brush with butter.  Continue laying
  filo, one sheet on top of another, brushing each with butter, to make a
  large "base" on which to roll the meat loaf (about 15 x 15 inches).
  Spread half of the saltsa aspri in the center of the filo, alowing wide
  margins for turning later.  Spread the meat mixture over the sauce to a
  length of about 9 inches. Lay the egg slices over the meat, cover with the
  remaining sauce, and sprinkle with parsley. Turn the edges of the filo up
  over the meat and roll into a loaf.  Fold the paper over the loaf, secure
  it, and place, seam side down, in a baking pan.  Bake for 1 hour in
  moderate oven (350 F), removing the paper after 35 minutes to allow the
  filo to get crisp.  Brush the outer surface of the filo with butter or
  margarine for a higher golden chestnut color.

  With wide spatulas, lift the loaf onto a warm platter.  Serve immediately,
  with fresh green salad, black olives, and a heady wine.

    1/4 c  Grated kefalotiri cheese
    1/2 c  Diced haloumy or feta cheese

  Oven temperature: 180�C (350�F)
  Cooking time: 2 hours

  Have meat retailer cut chops about 4 cm (1-1/4 inches) thick.
  Alternatively purchace a leg of lamb and have it cut into 6 pieces.

  Place lamb in a baking dish and spread or pour oil or butter on top.  Bake
  in a moderate oven for 20 minutes.

  Add onion to dish and return to oven for further 10 minutes.  Add tomato
  puree, chopped tomatoes, cloves, cinnamon bark and salt and pepper to
  taste.  Baste meat with liquid and cook for futher hour until meat is
  tender, adding a little of the water or stock if necessary.

  When meat is cooked add water or stock and stir in pasta.  Cook for futhre
  20 minutes, stirring occasionally, and adding a little more liquid if
  mixture looks dry.  When pasta is tender, sprinkle cheese over pasta and
  return to oven for 5 minutes.  Serve immediately.

  NOTE: This is a popular restaurant dish in Greece, Cyprus and Egypt.  The
  pieces of meat are placed in individual casserole dishes after the initial
  cooking, and the sauce, pasta and water or stock added to each dish, then
  cooking completed.  In the home I suggest dividing the meat and pasta ater
  it is cooked and just before adding the cheese.  Return to oven for cheese
  to melt.

    3/4 c  Chopped fresh parsley
    1/4 c  Chopped fresh dill, packed
      4 tb Chopped fresh mint
      2 c  Peeled, seeded tomatoes

  Wash and clean squid.  Grasp the head just below the eyes, pull it off
  from the rest of the body, and set it aside.  Cut away the thin purplish
  membrane on the outside of the tail section.  Using your index finger,
  scoop out and discard the guts and thin cartilage "icicle" on the inside
  of the tail section.  Rinse tail sections inside and out and set aside in
  a colander to drain.  Take the head section in one hand and put pressure
  with your thumb and forefinger around the mouth and eyes, to squeeze them
  out.  Discard mouth and eyes.

  Chop the squid tentacles and have them ready, as they will be used in the
  stuffing.

  In a large skillet, heat half the oilve oil and saute onion until wilted.
  Add rice, tentacles, and pine nuts and saute over medium-low heat for 2 to
  3 minutes.  Add garlic and currants to rice and stir quickly with a
  woodent spoon.  Pour in 1/4 cup wine and 1/4 cup water.  Season with salt
  and pepper.  Reduce heat to low and simmer, covered, until liquid is
  almost completely absorbed and rice is soft but only about half cooked,
  about 15 minutes.  About 5 minutes before removing skillet from heat, add
  parsley, dill and mint.  Remove and let cool enough to handle.

  Using a small teaspoon or a butter knife, carefully fill about three
  quarters of each squid with the rice mixture.  Use toothpicks to secure
  closed.  Pour remaining olive oil into a large stewing pot.  Place squid
  carefully in pot.  Pour in remaining wine and enough water to cover.
  Bring to a boil, reduce heat to low, and simmer, covered for about 1-1/2
  hours, or until rice is cooked and squid fork-tender.  Twenty minutes
  before removing squid from heat, add chopped tomatoes to pot and adjust
  seasoning with salt and pepper.  Check throughout cooking to see if more
  water is necessary so that mixture doesn't dry out.  Serve squid hot or
  cold with a simple green salad.

  SERVING SUGGESTIONS: This dish needs a delicate wine such as a Robola
  Callinga or Santorini Boutari.  Serve with wild greens (horta), 'horiatiki
  salata (village salad), and a beautiful olive bread.

      Title: Moustokouloura
 Categories: Cookies, Greek
   Servings: 24

  3 1/2 c  All-purpose flour
      2 ts Baking soda
      1 tb Freshly ground cinnamon
      1 tb Freshly ground cloves
    1/4 c  Mild olive oil
      2 tb Honey
    1/2 c  Petimezi
    1/2    Orange; (grated zest)
      1 c  Orange juice

  Sift together the flour, baking soda, cinnamon, and cloves into a large
  bowl, making a well in the center.  In a smaller bowl, beat the olive oil
  with the honey, petimezi, grated orange zest, and 1/2 the orange juice and
  pour into the well.  Mix together to make a dough, adding the remaining
  orange juice as necessary.

  Turn onto a floured surface and knead for about 10 minutes until the dough
  is smooth but not stiff.  Cover with a cloth and leave to relax for 30
  minutes or longer.

  Break off pieces of dough, about 2 tablespoonfuls each, and roll into
  snakes about 1/2-inch in diameter.  Press the two ends together, forming
  oval wreaths, and place on an oiled or non-stick baking sheet.  Bake in an
  oven preheated to 375 F for 10-15 minutes- until they are brown and
  crunchy, but not too hard.

      Title: BRIAMI - Greek vegetable casserole
 Categories: Vegetarian, Main dish, Side dish, Casseroles, Greek
   Servings:  6

      1    Eggplant
      2 lb Zucchini
      4 md Potatoes
      2    Green peppers
      1    Red pepper
      2 md Onions
      1 c  Olive oil
      4 md Tomatoes
      2    Garlic cloves
      1 ts Sugar
           Salt & pepper; to taste

  (1)  Prepare the vegetables: Cut the eggplant, zucchini  and  potatoes
     in  bite sized chunks (do not peel the zucchini or the eggplant).
     Remove the stems and seeds from the peppers and slice  them  into
     strips. Peel and slice the onions. Dice the tomatoes.

  (2)  Saute' the vegetables except the tomatoes  in  the  olive  oil  in
     small  batches.  Saut' each batch for 2 or 3 minutes, then remove
     from the pan, trying to drain some of the oil so that enough  oil
     is  left  for the next batch. When you're done, most (if not all)
     of the oil should be gone from the pan.

  (3)  Place the saute'ed vegetables in a  baking  dish  and  toss  them
     briefly  so  that you won't get only one kind of vegetable in one
     place.

  (4)  Add the tomatoes into the pan and saut' for a couple of  minutes.
     Crush the garlic and add to the tomatoes. Add the sugar, salt and
     pepper to taste and simmer for another minute.

  (5)  Pour the tomato sauce on top of the vegetables and  bake  at  350
     deg. F or until the vegetables are tender.

  (6)  Serve with plenty of fresh bread and,  if  you  like,  some  feta
     cheese on the side.

  RATING
  Difficulty:  easy.   Time:  30-45  minutes  preparation,  1  hour baking.
  Precision: No need to measure.

      Title: Spanakopita Nistisimi (Lenten Spinach Pie)
 Categories: Appetizers, Main dish, Greek, Vegetarian, Vegan
   Servings:  8

      1 lb Curly endive
      3 lb Fresh bulk spinach
      3 bn Large scallions
      5 tb Fruity olive oil
      1    Lemon
  1 1/2 c  Finely chopped fresh dill
      1 ts Salt
           Freshly ground black pepper
      1 tb Rice or cracked wheat
  1 1/2 c  All-purpose flour
           Extra flour for rolling
      1 ts Sea salt
      1 ts Baking powder
      5 tb Olive oil (about)
      1 tb Sesame seeds

  Start by making the pastry.  Sift the flour with the salt and baking
  powder. Mix in about 6 tablespoons water, a little at a time, until the
  dough is gooey, but not wet.  Add 1 tablespoon olive oil, plus another
  teaspoonful, and a little more flour, if needed, to make a cohesive mass.
  Knead the dough for 5 to 10 minutes, until smooth and elastic.  Cover it
  and set aside to relax for an hour or two.

  For the filling, separate the curly endive leaves, so the vegetable will
  cook in the same time.  Steam the spinach and endive together in a large
  pan, in the water clinging to the leaves, plus just an extra 1/2 cup.
  Turn the leaves over occasionally, so they wilt evenly.  When they are
  wilted, but not mushy, drain them in a colander, pressing firmly with the
  back of a wooden spoon to remove as much excess liquid as possible.
  (Reserve the liquid for use in soup, or drink with a squeeze of lemon
  juice, as the Greeks do.)

  Saute the scallions in 2 tablespoons olive oil, until barely soft.  Add a
  few tablespoons of water if they stick to the pan.  Roughly chop the
  cooked spinach and curly endive and finely grate the zest from the lemon.
  Then toss the cooked vegetables with the scallions, parsley, dill, lemon
  zest and 1 tablespoon lemon juice, salt, and pepper, adding 3 tablespoons
  olive oil. Set aside until you are ready to fill the pastry.

  Choose an ovenproof earthenware or glass baking dish 2 to 2-1/2 inches
  deep and about 2-quart capacity and brush the inside with oil.  Divide the
  pastry into two unequal parts, and then again into halves.  On a floured
  surface roll out one of the larger pieces of pastry. This should be large
  enough to line the dish, coming up and over the sides - this should make
  it very thin.  Fit it into the baking dish and brush it with olive oil.
  Do the same with the second piece of pastry, placing it on top of the
  first, and brush again with olive oil.

  Sprinkle the tablespoon of rice or cracked wheat over the bottom, to soak
  up excess juices, and fill with the spinach and herb mixture.  Roll out
  the remaining two pieces of pastry, separately, to fit the top of the
  dish.  Place the first on top of the spinach, brush with olive oil, then
  place the second on top of that.  Prick the pastry with a fork in an
  attractive pattern and brush the entire top with olive oil.  Sprinkle with
  sesame seeds.  Bake in an oven preheated to 350 F for 45-50 minutes, until
  golden brown.

   Servings: 20

    750 g  Fresh spinach; -OR-
    500 g  -Frozen leaf spinach
      1 c  Finely chopped spring onions
    1/4 c  Olive oil
      2 c  Crumbled feta cheese
    1/4 c  Finely chopped dill
      2    Eggs; beaten
    1/4 ts Ground nutmeg
           Salt
           Freshly ground pepper
     10    Filo pastry sheets
    1/2 c  Olive oil

  OVEN TEMPERATURE: 190�C (375�F)
  COOKING TIME: 40 Minutes

  Wash spinach well and cut off any coarse stems.  Chop coarsely and put
  into a large pan.  Cover and place over heat for 7-8 minutes shaking pan
  now and then or turning spinach with a fork.  Heat just long enough to
  wilt spinach so that juices can run freely.  Drain well in a colander,
  pressing occasionally with a spoon.  (If using frozen spinach, defrost,
  drain well and chop).  Place in a mixing bowl.

  Heat oil in a frying pan and gently fry spring onion until soft.  Add oil
  and onion to spinach with cheese, herbs, eggs and nutmeg.  Mix well to
  combine, then add salt and pepper to taste.

  Open out fillo pastry sheets and cut in half, giving pieces approximately
  20 x 30 cm (8 x 12 inches) in size.  Stack and cover with cloth.

  Take a sheet and brush lightly with oil.  Fold in half to make a strip
  about 10 cm (4 inches) wide.  Brush again with oil and spread about 2
  tablespoons of filling across one long edge, leaving sides clear of
  filling.  Fold in sides, then roll up firmly.  Bend roll round into a coil
  and place in an oiled baking dish.  Repeat with remaining ingredients,
  placing in one layer in the baking dish.

  Brush tops lightly with oil and bake in a moderately hot oven for 25
  minutes until golden brown.  Serve hot or cold as an appetizer or light
  meal.  If serving cold, use butter instead of olive oil unless your oil is
  of high quality.

  which grow only in Macedonia are extremely hot and very tasty.

  You fry them in oil, you peel their skin and you chop them into very small
  pieces. How many it depends on how hot they are and how spicy you can eat.
  After, you cut about 1 pound of feta in to small pieces and you mix it
  with the peppers. Add about 3 table spoons of olive oil. Work all the
  ingredients with the fork until it becomes a paste. Be carefull: I said
  with fork. Not with food processor, not with goudhi. Just FORK. :)

  You are all set. Enjoy with bread or crackers as appetizer.

 Categories: Greek, Appetizers, Vegan, Jacobs
   Servings: 16

      6 bn Scallions
    1/2 c  Olive oil
    3/4 c  Chopped fresh dill
           Salt
           Freshly ground black pepper
      8    Filo pastry sheets; thawed
      2 tb Sesame seeds

  Toss the chopped scallions in a bowl with 1 tablespoon olive oil, the
  chopped dill, salt and pepper.

  Remove 8 sheets of filo from the package. Reseal package and refrigerate
  it.  Cover the filo you are using with a damp dish towel, well wrung out,
  and try to work hastily, as the pastry sheet have a tendency to dry out.

  Lay out one sheet of filo and brush thoroughly with olive oil.  Lay a
  second sheet over the first, and brush again with olive oil.  Leaving a
  margin of 1 inch down one short side of the filo, sprinkle one-fourth of
  the scallion mixture in a strip.  Roll up from the same side, to make a
  long tube, packing the ends well.  Place on a greased baking sheet.

  Repeat this procedure three more times.  Cut each tube diagonally into
  four sections, brush with olive oil, and sprinkle the tops with sesame
  seeds.  Bake in an oven preheated to 350 F until the tops are crisp and
  golden brown - about 30 minutes.  They are good hot or cold.

      Title: Kouloura Rolls and Buns
 Categories: Greek, Breads
   Servings:  1

      2 tb Dry or cake yeast
    1/2 c  -Warm water
      2 c  Milk; warm
      3 tb -Sugar; -OR-
      5 tb Sugar; if making Koulourakia
      3 tb Butter, margarine or oil
    3/4 ts Salt
      7 c  All-purpose flour; unsifted
      1    Egg
      1    Egg yolk
    1/4 c  Sesame seeds

  Melt yeast in warm water.  Set aside.  Bring milk to boil.  Add sugar,
  butter and salt.  Allow milk to cool slightly.

  Put flour in a large bowl leaving about a tablespoon of it in the
  measuring cup for hands and make a hole in the center.  Pour liquid into
  it.  Add yeast and egg.  Start mixing with spoon or paddle, pushing flour
  from all sides into center.  Dough will be sticky until flour is absorbed.
  Begin kneading dough in the bowl and then transfer it to a lightly floured
  board.  Continue kneading until dough is smooth and elastic, about 20
  minutes.

  Place dough in a greased bowl.  Cover with towel dampened with hot water.
  Set aside in a warm place to rise until bulk has doubled, about 4 hours.

  Punch down in the middle.  Knead for a few minutes and shape into a round
  loaf or into individual rolls (see below).  Using fingers, rub top with
  egg yolk and sprinkle with sesame seeds.  Place in greased baking pans.
  Let rise once more, uncovered, in a warm place, approximately 1 hour.

  Bake in preheated oven at 375 F for 45 minutes.  Remove from oven; allow
  to cool 10 minutes before removing bread from pan.

  To Shape Traditional KOULOURA:  Divide dough into 3 long ropes.  Braid
  together.  Place braid in a greased tube pan or a large round baking pan.
  Stretch dough to make ends meet.  Use egg yolk to stick ends together.

  To Shape KOULOURAKIA Rolls:  Pinch off pieces of dough.  Roll on board
  with the palms of your hands to make a rope 6" long.  Twist it into a
  hairpin, coil the ends around each other and stick the tips together with
  a dab of egg yolk.  Or coil it like a snake, round and round; or roll into
  small round balls using the palms of your hands.  Do not flatten or press
  down as you roll.

      4    Fresh tomatoes; chopped -OR-
      8 oz -Tomato sauce
      3    Allspice berries

  After washing the rabbit or hare thoroughly and cutting into serving
  pieces, place in a large glass or earthenware bowl.  Make a marinade by
  combining the celery, onions, carrots, herbs, peppercorns, wine, and
  vinegar and pouring over the meat.  Cover and refrigerate for a day or
  two, turning the pieces over occasionally.

  On serving day, drain, reserving the marinade, and wipe dry.  Transfer the
  marinade to a casserole and simmer for 15 minutes.  While the marinade is
  cooking, heat the butter in a large frying pan, and when very hot sear the
  meat over high heat until it is reddened in color without browning.
  Remove from the heat, and with a spatula lift the rabbit or hare pieces
  into the simmering marinade, then pour in the remaining butter.  Taste for
  seasoning, then add the salt and pepper, tomatoes, and allspice.  Weight
  the meat with a small plate to keep it under the sauce, then bake it in a
  very slow oven (225 F) for 2-1/2 hours, or until the meat is tender and
  the sauce thickened.

      Title: Lagos/Kounelli Stifado
 Categories: Meats, Greek, Main dish
   Servings:  6

      1    Rabbit or hare
    1/4 c  Butter
      2 lb Small white onions
      1 c  Canned tomato sauce
      3    Whole cloves
      2    Garlic cloves
      1 tb Raisins (optional)
      1    Bay leaf
      1 ts Granulated sugar
    1/2 c  Dry white wine
      2 tb Wine vinegar
           Fresh rosemary

  Remove the rabbit or hare from the marinade and wipe dry.  In a large
  casserole, heat the butter or oil and sear the rabbit or hare over high
  heat until reddened in color, without browning the fat.  Meanwhile, peel
  the onions and cut a cross in the root end with a sharp pointed knife to
  keep them from falling apart during cooking.  Arrange around the rabbit or
  hare, then stir in the remaining ingredients, add enough water to cover,
  place an inverted plate over the meat and bring to a boil.  Transfer to a
  very slow oven (225 F) and bake for 2 to 2-1/2 hours, until the rabbit or
  hare and onions are tender.  Remove from the oven and carefully pour off
  the sauce into a small saucepan.  Boil down to 1-1/2 cups.  Remove plate
  from casserole, pour the sauce over, and garnish with additional rosemary.
  Serve warm.

  NOTE: The flavor improves the second day.

      Title: Loukanika
 Categories: Greek, Meats
   Servings: 20

      1 lb Lean pork shoulder, ground
    1/2 lb Fresh pork rind; boiled for 2 hours; drained, and ground
    1/2 lb Pork fatback, ground
      1 ts Salt
      1    Navel orange
      1 ts Crushed dried marjoram
      1    Bay leaf; ground in a mortar
    1/3 c  Dry red wine
      1 ts Ground allspice or coriander
           Freshly ground black pepper
      2    Garlic cloves; crushed
           Sausage casing

  Grind the pork, pork rind, and fatback through the fine blade of a meat
  chopper.  Combine in a large bowl with all the seasonings.  Knead
  thoroughly.  Store in the refrigerator while you prepare the casing.

  Ususally salted, the casing (pork intestine) especially the interior, must
  be rinsed under cold running water several times.  (To avoid losing casing
  down the drain while doing this, be sure the casing is inside a very large
  pan!)  Allow to drain on a linen towel.

  Use a pastry bag to force the stuffing into the casing.  Pinch at 3-1/2 to
  4 inch intervals allowing space between to form the sausage links.
  Normally the casing will not break, but if it does, that section must be
  discarded and a knot tied in the new "end".  To cook, poach in water for 1
  hour, then drain, discarding the cooking water.  Fry the sausages in a
  frying pan over moderate heat, or use as suggested in any recipe.  Drain
  and serve hot.

  Note: To store, freeze uncooked in meal-sized batches.  The sausages
  should be used within a day or two if not frozen.

      Title: Sheftalia (Barbequed Sausages)
 Categories: Greek, Cypriot, Meats
   Servings: 50

    500 g  Finely ground fatty pork
    500 g  Finely ground veal or lamb
      1 lg Onion; finely chopped
    1/2 c  Finely chopped parsley
      2 ts Salt
    250 g  Panna (caul fat from pig)

  Combine pork with veal or lamb, onion, parsley, salt and a generous
  grinding of black pepper.

  Dip panna into a bowl of warm water for a minute or two, remove and
  carefully open out a piece at a time, laying it out flat on work surface.
  Cut with kitchen scissors into pieces about 10 cm (4 inches) square.

  Take a good tablespoon of meat mixture and shape into a thick sausage
  about 5 cm (2 inches) long.  Place towards one edge of piece of panna,
  fold end and sides over meat and roll up firmly.  Repeat with remaining
  ingredients.

  Thread sausages on flat sword-like skewers, leaving space between them.
  Number on each skewer depends on their length.

  Cook over glowing charcoal, turning frequently.  Do not place too close to
  heat as sheftalia must cook fairly slowly so that the inside is well
  cooked and the outside nicely browned without being burnt.  The panna
  melts during cooking, keeping the meat moist and adding flavour.
  Excessive flaring of fire can be controlled by a sprinkle of water on the
  coals.  Serve sheftalia as an appetizer or a main course.

    1/2    Lemon; strained juice only
           Black olive; for garnish

  Htipiti (pronounced h-tee-pee-TEE and translated as "that which is
  beaten") is the name Macedonians gave to this tart feta spread.  The
  longer it is beaten, the more tart it will be.

  In medium-size bowl, mash feta with fork or potato masher and slowly add
  olive oil, chopped peppers, oregano, and black pepper.  Pulverize mixture
  for about 10 minutes (less if using a food processor), pouring in lemon
  juice a little at a time, until feta is creamy.  Cover and refrigerate at
  least 1 hour before serving.  Yields about 1 cup.

      Title: Honey Cookies (Melomakarona)
 Categories: Cookies, Greek
   Servings: 60

      1 c  Butter
    3/4 c  Caster sugar
    3/4 c  Maize or peanut oil
      1    Orange; grated rind only
      6 c  Plain flour
      4 ts Baking powder
    3/4 c  Orange juice
      1 tb Honey
      2 ts Orange juice
  1 1/2 ts Ground cinnamon
  1 1/2 c  Finely chopped walnuts
      2 dr Almond essence
      1 c  Sugar
      1 c  Water
    1/2    Cinnamon stick
  1 1/2 ts Lemon juice
      1    Thin strip of lemon rind
    1/4 c  Honey

  Oven temperature: 180 C (350 F)

  Beat butter and sugar with orange rind until creamy.  Gradually add oil
  and continue beating until mixture is very light and fluffy.  Stir in
  flour alternately with orange juice.  Knead dough lightly with hands for 1
  minute.

  Take a scant tablespoon of dough and flatten it a little.  Place a
  teaspoon of the nut filling in the centre and fold dough over to enclose
  filling.

  Shape into ovals, pinching ends to a point.  Decorate tops with tines of
  fork or by crimping cookies diagonally across top in four rows with
  special crimper (see NOTE), or leave them plain.

  Place on lightly greased baking trays and bake in a moderate oven for
  20-25 minutes until golden brown.  Cool on wire racks.

  Dip in boiling syrup, four at a time, turning cookies once.  Leave in
  syrup 10 seconds in all, longer if well-soaked cookies are preferred.
  Lift out onto a plate and leave until cool.

  (If no nut filling is used, sprinkle tops with crushed walnuts or toasted
  sesame seeds and cinnamon.  Only those which are to be served should be
  dipped; store remainder in an airtight container and dip when required.

  TO MAKE NUT FILLING: Thin honey down with orange juice and blend into
  remaining ingredients.

  TO MAKE HONEY SYRUP: Place ingredients in a heavy-based saucepan and stir
  over heat until sugar dissolves.  Bring to the boil and boil over
  moderately high heat for 10 minutes and skim.  Let syrup boil on a
  moderate heat while dipping cookies.  Add a little water to syrup when it
  thickens too much during dipping.

  NOTE: Icing crimpers will be familiar to many pastrycooks and cake
  decorators who work with icing.  If you don't own a crimper (or have never
  seen one), have the family handyman cut a piece of tin or aluminium plate
  about 2.5 x 10 cm (1 x 4 inches).  Bend metal in half over a thin rod and
  cut 6 to 8 evenly spaced saw-like teeth on the narrow edges.  Curl the
  "teeth" slightly inwards.

      Title: Melomakarona Andonias
 Categories: Cookies, Desserts, Greek, Vegan
   Servings: 48

      7 c  All-purpose unbleached flour
           Extra flour for kneading
  1 1/2 ts Baking soda
    1/4 ts Salt
  1 3/4 c  Mild olive oil
  1 1/4 c  Sugar
    1/2 c  Cognac
      3    Oranges; zested and juiced
      4 ts Freshly ground cinnamon
  1 1/2 ts Freshly ground clove
    3/4 ts Freshly grated nutmeg
      1 lb Honey; (1 lb = about 2 cups)
      1 c  Sugar
      1    1-inch piece of cinnamon
      1    Clove
      1    Lemon; zested and juiced
      1 c  Water
    1/2 c  Shelled almonds
      1 tb Sugar
      1 ts Freshly ground cinnamon

  Author's note: These cakes are traditionally served at Christmas.  This
  recipe comes from my neighbor, Andonia.  I have a distinct memory of her
  beating the oil and sugar into the flour until it dissolved using her
  middle finger and forefinger as a beater - though a spoon will do.

  Start by making the syrup.  Put the honey, sugar, cinnamon, clove, and
  lemon zest in a saucepan and add the water.  Bring to a boil and simmer
  for 5-10 minutes.  Add the lemon juice, then chill.

  To blanch the almonds, plunge them into boiling water for 1-2 minutes,
  until you see signs of their skins loosening.  Then drain and slip or pop
  them from their skins onto a baking sheet.  Toast them in an oven
  preheated to 350 F for about 10 minutes - just until they begin to color.
  Cool, then chop them very, very finely - if you do this in a food
  processor, make sure that the pulses are short, or the nuts could turn
  oily.  Mix the ground almonds with the sugar and cinnamon and reserve.

  Sift the flour, baking soda and salt together.  Put the olive oil and
  sugar in a large bowl and beat together - with your fingers like Andonia -
  or with a wooden spoon.  Beat in the Cognac, the orange zest, spices, and
  juice from 2 oranges (about 1/2 cup).

  Then beat in the flour, a few spoonfuls at a time, until you have a
  malleable dough, adding more flour if it is too soft, and more orange
  juice if it is too stiff.  Turn the dough onto a floured surface and knead
  for 10-15 minutes until very smooth.

  Pinch off pieces of dough of about 2 tablespons and form into flattened
  oval or lozenge shapes.  Place them on an oiled or non-stick baking sheet.
  Bake in an oven preheated to 400-425 F for about 20 minutes, until brown.

  When they are cool enough to handle, dip them in the bowl of syrup for
  about 1 minute.  Remove with a slotted spoon and place on a tray to cool.
  Sprinkle with the chopped almond mixture.

      Title: Boned Oysters
 Categories: Greek, Ancient, Seafood
   Servings:  1

     12    Oysters, fresh or frozen
      1 c  Flour
    1/2 c  Oil
           Salt and pepper; to taste

  Use only the large Asiatic oysters caught in the Indian Ocean, Black Sea,
  or the Persian and Arabian gulfs.

  Use the delicious white meat only.  Discard the round white bone sometimes
  discovered inside the shell -- or give it to some Persian.  They seem to
  prefer these bones to gold; they call them "pearls".
     *********************************************************************

  Drain oysters.  Roll in flour.  Heat oil until hot in a large frying pan.
  Fry oysters on medium-high heat for 5 minutes turning over once.  Sprinkle
  with seasonings and serve.

           -mozarella, or combination
           -of)
 
  Peel and slice potatoes.  Line cookie sheet with tin foil.  Spray
  foil with non-stick spray (Pam)  In large bowl, combine potatoes,
  green onions, green peppers and white onions.  Pour onto foil lined
  pan.  In same bowl, mix barbecue sauce, water, and dry spices.  Pour
  over top of potatoes.  Bake in 400 F oven for 45 minutes.  Turn and
  seperate to ensure even cooking. Bake an additional 10 minutes or so.
  (Baking time depends on how thick you slice the spuds) Sprinkle
  grated cheese on top of cooked potatoes, and continue cooking until
  cheese has melted and the edges become crispy. Let sit for about 4-5
  minutes before serving to allow the cheese to set up a bit.

      Title: Old-California Empanaditas
 Categories: Cheese, Mexican
      Servings: 6 servings
 
      1 c  Butter
      1 pk (8 oz) Cream Cheese
    1/2 ts Salt
      2 c  Unsifted all-purpose flour
      1    Egg yolk
      2 ts Cream or milk
 
  Beat butter, cheese and salt together in a mixer until completely
  smooth and blended.  Work in flour to a smooth dough.  (You can use a
  mixer for this step, too, but results are superior if you work in the
  flour with your fingertips, a fork or rubber spatula).  Flatten dough
  in foil to form a an 8 X 6 inch rectangle.  Chill overnight.  (You
  can chill it several days before using).  Remove from refrigerator 8
  to 10 minutes before rolling. (Many recipes suggest a 30 minute wait
  before rolling dough, but it's easier to handle when rolled as cold
  as possible). Divide dough for ease in rolling and to insure cold
  dough.
  
  Keep unrolled portion in refrigerator until ready to use.  Roll on
  floured pastry cloth with floured rolling pin or between two sheets
  of waxed paper. The former is easier, in my opinion, and I find
  absolutely no sticking when I use a pastry cloth and covered pin.  I
  first rub cloth and pin well with flour, then shake out excess.  When
  using waxed paper, loosen it on both sides of pastry several times as
  you roll.
  
  Shape as directed in specific recipes and chill before baking.  Brush
  tops (only) of all pastries with egg yolk beaten with cream.  Bake in
  moderate oven (350 degrees) unless otherwise specified.

           Jim Vorheis
    1/3 c  Fresh lime juice
           Sea salt to taste
    1/3 c  Finely chopped radishes
    1/4 c  Finely chopped white onion
      1    Chile peron, black seeds
           -removed and roughly
           -chopped,
           Or any hot green chile,
           -chopped with seeds
      1 tb Roughly chopped cilantro
           The tacos:
      1 c  Drained and lightly salted
           -ricotta cheese
      6    Thin 5-inch corn tortillas
      6    Toothpicks
           Safflower oil for frying
 
  Have ready a tray lined with a double thickness of paper toweling.
  
  First make the sauce.  Put the lime juice and salt into a glass bowl,
  mix in the rest of the ingredients, and leave for at least 30 minutes
  to marinate.  This should make about 1 cup.
  
  Spread 1 tablespoon of the ricotta over half of each tortilla. Fold
  over and secure with a toothpick.
  
  Put oil to a depth of 1/4 inch in a large frying pan and heat. When
  hot but not smoking, add a few of the tacos and fry, turning once
  until they are a golden color and quite crisp.  Continue with the
  rest, adding oil if necessary.
  
  Drain the tacos well on paper toweling and remove as soon as they are
  cool enough to handle.  With a toothpick, ease them open and insert
  about 2 tablespoons of the sauce.  Serve immediately; they cannot
  wait.

      Title: Texas Cheese Enchiladas
 Categories: Mexican, Cheese
      Servings: 4 servings
 
     12    Corn Tortillas
      4 tb Cooking Oil
      2 lg Onions, Chopped
      4 c  Grated Cheddar Cheese
      2 tb Shortning (Lard Best)
      2 tb Flour
      2 tb Chile Powder Or Ground Chile
 
  Allow 3 enchiladas per person. Use a Pyrex utility pan (13-1/2" x
  8-3/4") to cook them. Lightly grease the utility pan (for
  authenticity use laed). Preheat the oven to 400�F. Chop onions and
  grate cheese. Saute the onions lightly in 2 T. oil. Melt lard in a
  skillet; stir in the flour and make a light roux.  Add ground chiles
  or chile powder, water and salt, and cook until thick. Of commercial
  chile powders, Gebhardt's from San Antonio is best, but not as good
  as ground *chiles pasillas*. Heat the remaining oil in a skillet.
  Using kitchen tongs, dip each tortilla in hot oil until well softened
  (about 15 seconds). Hold tortilla up and allow oil to drip back into
  the skillet. Using the tongs, dip tortillas in chili gravy. Place the
  tortilla in the Pyrex pan,  put a good sized pinch of cheese and
  onions in the middle, and roll the tortilla, placing the flap side
  down. Continue filling and rolling tortillas until the pan is full.
  Pour more chili gravy on top of the enchiladas, sprinkle the top
  generously with more grated cheese, and pop into preheated oven. Cook
  only until the cheese begins to bubble (about 10 minutes). Serve
  immediately.

  SELECTING THE RIGHT CHOCOLATE:  You'll find three basic types of chocolate
  in the baking supplies department of most supermarkets--semisweet
  chocolate, unsweetened chocolate, and sweet chocolate.  The semisweet
  chocolate is made from chocolate that is just slightly sweetened with
  sugar.  Unsweetened chocolate is the original baking or cooking chocolate
  and has no added flavorings or sugar.  And sweet chocolate, such as the
  German cooking chocolate used in the Chocolate Pots de Creme recipe, is
  chocolate mixed with sugar and sometimes additional cocoa butter or
  flavorings.

      Title: JERRY ELLIOTT'S SPAGHETTI SAUCE
 Categories: Italian, Pasta, Beef, Pork, Vegetables
      Servings: 4 servings
 
    1/2 lb Hamburger
    1/2 c  Sliced fresh mushrooms
      3    Slices chopped bacon
      1 ts Salt (or to taste)
      1 ts Pepper (or to taste)
    1/2 lb Italian sausage
    1/4 c  Wine (or to taste)
      1 tb Olive oil
      1 ds Cinnamon (or to taste)
      1 ds Ground cloves (or to taste)
      1    Chopped onion
      1    Chopped green pepper
      1    6 oz can tomato paste
      1    2.5# can Ital tomatoes+juic
      1    Bay leaf
    1/2 ts Basil
           Several cloves sliced garlic
 
  Saute bacon and some onion in oil.  Then add beef, sausage, green pepper
  and the rest of the onion.  Cook until meat is browned.  Then add
  mushrooms, tomatoes (with juice), bay leaf and seasonings.  Simmer for 1
  hour.  Add tomato paste and wine and simmer for another 30 minutes.
  If your sauce winds up being a little runny, add some more tomato paste or
  let simmer uncovered till desired consistency is achieved.
  I rarely make this recipe the same way twice.  It's a very forgiving
  recipe and experimentation is reccommended.  Try adding a dash of
  Worchestershire sauce and/or a dash of bitters.  Add some oregano,
  whatever you like.  This recipe also doubles very easily.
  The amount of garlic was purposely vague as I'm one of those people who
  feel that you can never have enough garlic.  If you're not a
  garlic-aholic, you probably will only need one clove of garlic.
  This was given to me by my father Jerry Elliott.

    1/2 ts Worcestershire Sauce
    1/2 ts Lemon juice (concentrate)
    1/8 ts Thyme
    1/4 ts Marjoram
      1 pn Rosemary
      1 ea Whole bay leaf
      1 pn Parsley, dried or flakes
      2 tb Heaping, grated Parmesan
 
  I rarely actually measure the ingredients, so they vary from sauce to
  sauce.
  
  Combine all except the grated Parmesan cheese.  Simmer covered, 30 minutes
  over low heat.  Add grated Parmesan (Kraft shaker style is fine) and simmer
  additional 15 minutes.
  
  Serve over hot pasta noodles.  Sprinkle more cheese on top.
  
    I have also substituted 3 or 4 drops Tabasco Sauce for the lemon juice.
  
    Vary spice quantities to suit taste.
  
  Enjoy! - Jeff Duke

      2 cl Garlic smashed and chopped
      2 tb Fresh Parsley
      1 c  Italian Tomatoes cut up
           2 1/2 cups - 28 oz can
      1    Tomato Paste  6 oz.can
    1/2 c  Red Wine
      4 oz Mushrooms cut up (large)
      1 tb Fresh Oregano
      2 tb Fresh Basil
  1 1/2 ts Salt
      1 tb Sugar if needed. See Note
           -OPTIONS
    1/2 lb Italian Sausage  See Note
    3/4 lb Ground Meat      See Note
    3/4 lb Chicken Strips   See Note
    1/2 lb Pork Cubed       See Note
 
  : NOTES: Onion, the type of onion will determine the sugar content of
  the sauce, taste at 1/2 hour to adjust sugar. Eggplant, peel and cut
  into 3/4 inch or so cubes. Wine, any dry wine will do, but Cabernet
  Sauvignon is now inexpensive and bold- "Vendange 1992 is what I use."
  : PRE-PREP: Mince onion, cube eggplant, smash and mince garlic, mince
  parsley, open cans of tomato and tomato paste, pour some wine for
  yourself.
  : METHOD: Heat oil till v hot, add onions and eggplant and
  stir often, the goal is to sweat nearly all of the fluid out of the
  vegetables. Add garlic, stir well and give the garlic a minute to blend.
  Add Tomatoes, stir well, add wine, and tomato paste, mix to blend, add
  parsley, oregano, and basil. Stir to blend well and simmer uncovered for
  about 15 minutes stirring often. Add option if desired, simmer for
  another 15 minutes. Taste and decide if the sauce needs some sugar,
  (sometimes the eggplant are a bit bitter and sugar is required). Add
  sugar if required and simmer for another 20 minutes or so. Add salt and
  stir well, taste the sauce and adjust seasoning at this point. MSN=add a
  dash of cayenne or other chili powder at the end and stir in to peak the
  flavors. : The total cooking time is 45 minutes to an hour, of course
  any sauce will be better the second day.
  : OPTIONS: Sausage, Pierce and
  steam the sausage to cook through and to exude some of the fat from the
  sausage or brown it well and drain the fat. Ground Meat, brown any lean
  ground meat in a skillet and drain. Chicken Strips, or cubes, grill or
  brown skinned chicken strips, or use turkey or duck. Pork cubes, grill
  or lightly brown lean pork chunks.
  Some folks will not eat Possum or Beaver unless it is made into this fine
  sauce.

           -chopped fine
      1 lg Jar of favorite spaghetti
           -sauce (or make your own)
      1 c  Rice (I used white, but I'm
           -sure that brown would work
           -too, though
           -you may need to add more
           -water)
      1 c  Water
      1 c  Sliced mushrooms (I'm sure
           -other veggies would work
           -too)
 
  In a dry, nonstick skillet "fry" the rice until it's brown in color.  Then
  put half of it in the bottom of a large casserole dish. Layer half of the
  shredded cabbage on top of it.
  
  Mix the water and the spaghetti sauce and then pour half of it over the
  cabbage.  Spread half of the mushrooms over this.  Then repeat your layers.

      Title: GREEN SPAGHETTI SAUCE
 Categories: Digest, Oct.
      Servings: 2 servings
 
      1    16 oz bag frozen or fresh
           Spinach
           (or a combination
           Frozen/fresh)
      1    Clove garlic,
           Crushed/minced
    1/2 c  Plain soy milk/skim milk
        x  Salt
 
  If using fresh spinach, wash and de-stem the leaves. Steam/microwave the
  spinach until cooked.  Place it in a blender with the garlic and milk. Whir
  until you have a nice sauce consistency. Start with less milk if you like a
  thicker sauce, add more, as needed. It depends on how much spinach "juice"
  you use.  Taste the sauce, and add salt, as desired.
  
  Serve on top of spaghetti or other pasta
  
  Makes 2-3 servings, with pasta
  
  NOTES: This makes a bright green sauce...kinda weird to look at but very
  good tasting.  It's a real pretty presentation if you serve it over
  spaghetti, half green, half tomato sauce.
  
  It's especially good with Parmesan, if you are lacto-veg. Use fat free, of
  course, or a tiny bit of "the good stuff".
  
  DO NOT use vanilla flavored soy milk. I tried it. Yuk.

      1 ea Italian seasoning to taste
      1 pn Black pepper
 
  It was good, but much more of a stew than a sauce.  Next time I make it,
  I'll use real onions, and two cans of tomatoes, and have containers ready
  to freeze most of it... my freezer is full these days. In summer, fresh
  tomatoes (and probably zucchini) would be good...

      Title: MAMA BRAUN'S SPAGHETTI SAUCE
 Categories: Entrees, Mom
      Servings: 1 batch
 
     15 lb Ground beef
           -(or 10 lb ground beef
           -and 5 lb ground lamb)
      2 qt Chicken necks and backs,
           -boiled down in own broth
      9 lb Onion, unpeeled
      2 qt Beef stock
  4 1/2 qt Bell peppers, blended
      3 ga Progresso tomato paste
      2 ts Salt
      3 lb Mushrooms
  2 2/3 c  Sugar
      1 tb Oregano
           Gunk, to taste
           -(see recipe)
 
  Fill two 5-gallon pots with equal portions of ground beef (or beef and
  lamb) and scramble over high heat until well-done.
  
  Blend onions and add to meat, along with beef juice.  Blend bell peppers
  and add to meat.  Add tomato paste and cut heat from high (boiling) to
  simmer.  Add salt, mushrooms, blended chicken meat, sugar, "gunk" and
  oregano.  This should be let to simmer for half a day to a full day. When
  finished, can freeze basic sauce in jars or ziploc bags.
  
  TO SERVE SAUCE:  Thaw 1 1/2 quart container of sauce (four servings). Peel
  and sliver 4 garlic cloves into blender; add 1 cup wine (use sherry or
  burgundy) and 1 T  brown sugar, blend. Add to sauce and heat until ready.
  
  Beau's notes:
  
  *  This sauce is patterned after that of a Syro-American restaurateur of
  Ocala whose restaurant, The Blue Bird, no longer exists. However, the
  spaghetti sauce recipe, one Mama (after trying at first more or less to
  duplicate the Blue Bird's) refined, is immortal. Because of the vegetables
  used in it, the family tradition has been to make a meal of spaghetti with
  the sauce alone. The basic sauce is useful also for lasagna and other pasta
  dishes.
  
  *  Mom uses juices from beef roasted with sherry and "gunk" for beef stock.
  
  *  The family is still  boycotting Hunt's anything!

      Title: SAUSAGE SPAGHETTI SAUCE
 Categories: Sauces, Usenet
      Servings: 1 batch
 
      1 lb Italian sausage
      2 md Onions
    1/2 lb Mushrooms
      1 sm Green pepper
           -(or use frozen
           -diced pepper)
      1 sm Eggplant
      1 md Tomato
      8 oz Tomato sauce
           -(1 standard can)
           Salt, pepper, oregano
           -to taste
 
  Slice the sausage into bite-size morsels and saute until browned.  Remove
  from pan, leaving fat for next step. (While the sausages are browning, you
  can cut up the vegetables.)
  
  Slice the onions and the mushrooms.  Cut the peppers into 1/2-inch squares
  and dice the tomato. Cut the eggplant into a julienne style.
  
  Add a little oil to the pan and saute the onions, peppers, mushrooms,
  eggplant and tomato until the onions are transparent and soft. Add the
  tomato sauce and the spices and return the sausage to the pan. Cook about
  15 minutes. Serve with fettucine.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  Spaghetti sauce with sausage, mushrooms and eggplant -- I made up this
  recipe the other day to use up some eggplant.  It was an instant hit.
  Servings: serves 13.
  
  *  Zucchini can be substituted for the eggplant, and canned tomatoes can be
  substituted for the tomato and sauce.  The sauce should be  relatively
  thick. The sausage can be hot or mild Italian sausage, but if you use mild
  sausage you will need to add more spices.

      Title: MICHAEL'S SPAGHETTI SAUCE
 Categories: Sauces, Pasta, Usenet
      Servings: 8 cups
 
------------------------------TOMATO PRODUCTS------------------------------
     12 oz Tomato paste
     16 oz Tomato sauce
     28 oz Tomato puree
     28 oz Tomatoes, crushed
---------------------------------SEASONINGS---------------------------------
      4    Garlic cloves
      1 lg Bay leaf
      1 tb Sugar
    1/2 ts Black pepper, ground
      1 tb Oregano
      1 tb Thyme
      1 ts Coriander
      2 ts Rubbed sage
      2 ts Cilantro (or less;
           -optional)
      2 tb Parsley
      2 ts Basil
    1/2 ts Red pepper, crushed
      1 md Onion
    1/3 c  Olive oil
      1 tb Sesame oil
---------------------------------MEATBALLS---------------------------------
    1/2 lb Italian sausage,
           -sweet
    1/2 lb Ground beef, lean
      4 tb Worcestershire sauce
      2 ts Sesame oil
      2 tb Olive oil
    1/3 c  Bread crumbs
      1 ts Sage
      2 ts Rosemary
      1 ts Thyme
      1 ts Basil
    1/2 c  Sherry
 
  Chop the garlic very finely.  Chop the onion.  Combine in a suitable pot
  the tomato products and seasonings. Bring to a simmer.
  
  In a bowl, combine the meatball ingredients except the sherry.  Break this
  mixture apart into small balls or bits according to preference.
  
  Heat a wok or skillet and saute the meat mixture until cooked to 'rare'. Do
  not overcook or singe the meat.  Remove the grease from the meat mixture by
  straining in a colander, then return to the hot wok or skillet and reheat.
  Add sherry and reduce.  Add this to the sauce in the pot.  Simmer this
  mixture on the lowest possible heat for 6 or 7 hours. Stir occasionally.
  
  NOTES:
  
  *  An exotically spiced spaghetti sauce with meat -- This is a very
  adaptable sauce which can be used in any recipe requiring tomato sauces.
  Best on spaghetti with garlic bread!
  
  *  I have found that Hunt's tomato products deliver the best flavor for
  this sauce; they are somewhat sweeter and less acidic than other brands. I
  always use Lea and Perrins Worcestershire sauce.
  
  *  This spaghetti sauce is the work of about 2 years experimentation.  It
  has won some of the local cooking contests here in Maine.
  
  : Difficulty:  easy but tedious.
  : Time:  1 hour preparation, 7 hours cooking.
  : Precision:  approximate measurement OK.

      Title: SPAGHETTI SAUCE (WITH WINE)
 Categories: Beef, Italian, Pasta
      Servings: 1 servings
 
      1 lb Ground Beef
      1    Onion -- chopped
      2    To 3 Cloves Garlic -- minced
      2    15-Oz Cans Tomato Sauce
      2    6-Oz Cans Tomato Paste
      1 tb Italian Seasoning -- or
           More
      1 ds Ground Oregano
    1/2 ts Salt
    1/4 ts Black Pepper
      1    Or 2 Glugs White Wine
 
  Brown the beef and onion in a huge skillet.  Add the garlic when the beef
  is almost done.  Stir in the tomato sauce, tomato paste and all the
  seasonings.  Simmer over low heat while you cook the pasta.  Like I said,
  about 15 minutes before you're ready to serve, stir the wine into the
  sauce.
  
  I've never found it necessary to let spaghetti sauce cook for hours and
  hours.  I don't have the time or the patience, and I like my spaghetti
  sauce better than anything canned/jarred, or ordered in a restaurant.  It's
  got a richer taste, what with the amount of tomato paste I use.  Sometimes
  I use a can of stewed tomatoes in place of one of the tomato sauces, but
  that's about the only variation I ever make.

      Title: GINA'S BASIC SPAGHETTI SAUCE
 Categories: Sauces
      Servings: 1 servings
 
      2 tb Olive oil
      1 sm Onion, chopped
    1/2 ts Fennel seeds
      3    Cloves garlic, minced
      1 sm Green pepper, chopped
      6    Ripe tomatoes, medium
     12 oz Can tomato puree
      6 oz Can tomato paste
      2 ts Oregano, dried
      1 ts Basil, dried
      1 tb Parsley, dried
      1 ts Salt
    1/4 ts Pepper
    1/4 c  Parmesan cheese
 
  Prepare the tomatoes:  drop them into a pot of boiling water for about a
  minute.  Drain and rinse with cold water.  Slip off the skins, cut out the
  "core", and coarsely chop.  Set aside.
  
  In a large pot, heat the oil.  Add onion & fennel seed.  Fry a couple
  minutes.  Add the pepper & garlic and fry a couple more minutes (don't let
  the precious garlic brown or burn, please!).  Add the rest of the
  ingredients.  Bring to a boil, lower heat, then simmer for as long as you
  can (at least an hour), stirring occasionally.  I cover the pot loosely
  when simmering.
  
  Notes:  You can use fresh herbs for the dried, and it's much better. Just
  triple the proportions for fresh.  You can also add other veggies to the
  sauce during the simmer phase:  carrots (shredded), green chilis (fresh
  roasted from New Mexico), chopped olives (black or green), sliced
  mushrooms.  You can also add TVP to fool meat eaters: soak 1 c TVP & 1/4 t
  fennel seed in 7/8 c boiling water for 10 min. Fry the TVP in some olive
  oil before adding to the sauce.
  
  Also, you might want to double or triple this recipe if your tomato
  "shrubs" look like mine  :-)
  
  Enjoy!

      Title: HERBED TOMATO SPAGHETTI SAUCE
 Categories: Seasonings, Italian, Sauces
      Servings: 1 batch
 
      2 tb Olive oil
      1 md Red onion; chopped
      1 md Bell pepper; chopped
      2    Or 3 garlic cloves; minced
      3 md Carrots; chopped
    1/2 lb Mushrooms; coarsely chopped
      8 c  Chopped fresh seeded
           -- tomatoes
           -or-
     28 oz Canned tomatoes
      1 ts Aniseed; crushed
      1    Bay leaf; broken
    1/4 c  Dry red wine
    1/4 c  Fresh oregano; chopped
    1/4 c  Fresh basil; chopped
    1/4 c  Italian parsley; chopped
      2 tb Lemon balm; chopped
 
  Saute onion, bell pepper, garlic and carrots in olive oil in a 4-qt.
  saucepan until vegetables are tender (about 10 minutes).  Add mushrooms and
  continue cooking 2 or 3 minutes more.
  
  Add tomatoes, bay leaf, aniseed and wine.  Simmer, uncovered, stirring
  occasionally, until sauce thickens (about 1 to 1 1/2 hours).
  
  Add oregano, basil, parsley and lemon balm; stir and simmer 15 to 20
  minutes longer to let flavors mingle.
  
  Cathy's note:  The recipe says nothing about removing the bay leaf
  afterward, but this is standard practice so that any sharp edges on it do
  not cause discomfort or physical damage to people.
  
  The editors wrote:  "Selecting a basic herb-tomato sauce from the many,
  many dozens that were submitted was [a]...chore.  This one edged out many
  other...entries for its simplicity, fresh approach, and the short cooking
  time after the leafy herbs were added.  While many excellent cooks take the
  'less is more' approach and add only fractions of teaspoons of herbs, we
  liked the more assertive style here and the surprising and intriguing
  addition of lemon balm (which cooks out to a mellow hint of
  not-quite-lemon).  This sauce depends on a greater-than-usual amount of
  chopped carrot to cut the acidity of fresh tomatoes."

    1/2 c  Kalamata olives
           -- pitted and halved
----------------------------------GARNISH----------------------------------
           Grated Parmesan cheese
 
  Heat olive oil in large Dutch oven.  Add anchovies and stir together until
  oil and anchovies make a paste.  Add the tomatoes, liquid and all. Break up
  the tomatoes and cook for 2 hours, then add the basil, oregano and half the
  garlic.  Cook for 6 to 8 hours, adding a little water as needed. The sauce
  will become a dark, rich red.  In the last half hour, add the remaining
  garlic, olives and capers.  Cook for a few minutes to blend the flavors.
  Serve over pasta and pass grated Parmesan.
  
  The editors wrote: "Anchovies, capers, olives and garlic result in a
  mysterious and wholly Italian taste experience that even anchovy haters
  tend to like.  This recipe was...the best of several on this theme. We
  would only suggest the possibility of adding the fresh herbs later in the
  cooking process."

           Marinade                            5 tb Ginger snap crumbs
 
  2 to 4 days before serving, wipe the meat with a damp cloth, then place in
  a large plastic bag.
  
  In a large bowl, throuoghly combine the vinegar, Coca-Cola, water, onions,
  celery, carrots, pepper, cloves, bay leaves, sugar, and salt and pour over
  meat.  Fasten bag tightly and lay flat in a 13x9-inch pan. Refrigerate,
  turning bag each day. (If you like a sour sauerbraten, let meat marinate 4
  days.)
  
  When ready to cook, remove meat (saving marinade) and dry well. Rub the
  surface lightly with flour.  In Dutch oven, heat oil or shortening and
  slowly brown the meat well on all sides.  Add 1 cup of the marinade liquid
  plus some of the vegetables and bay leaves. Cover tightly and simmer on
  surface heat or in a preheat, 350�F oven for 3 to 4 hours until the meat is
  fork-tender.  If needed, add more marinade during cooking to keep at least
  1/2-inch liquid in the Dutch oven. Remove the meat and keep warm until
  ready to slice.
  
  Into a large measuring cup, strain the drippings.  Add several ice cubes
  and let stand a few minutes until the fat separates out. Remove fat, then
  make gravy.  Makes 8 servings.
  
  TO MAKE THE GRAVY:  In the Dutch oven, combine the gravy ingredients, stir
  and cook about 5 minutes over medium heat until gravy is thickened. Taste
  for seasonings.  Makes 3 cups of gravy.

  beat at high speed of an electric mixer for 3 minutes, scraping the bowl
  often.
  
  In a bowl, combine the mashed bananas with the lemon juice; add to the
  batter.  Add the chopped nuts to the batter and beat for 1 minute at medium
  speed.  Turn the batter into a well-greased, lightly floured, 13x9x2-inch
  pan.

  the ingredients except the vanilla extract.  Beat 1 minute at high speed of
  an electric mixer.  Place over boiling water (the water should not touch
  the bottom of the top half of the double boiler.). Beat on high speed about
  7 minutes until the frosting forms peaks when the mixer is raised.
  
  Remove from boiling water (for the smoothest frosting, empty into a large
  bowl).  Add the vanilla extract and continue beating on high speed until
  thick enough to spread, about 2 minutes.  Spread on the sides and top of
  the cold banana cake.

      2    Egg whites                     
 
  Raisin Puree is the basis for the dough of this rich-tasting, chewy bar.
  The combination of orange and chocolate is a classic favorite. We
  considered cutting the amount of chocolate in the recipe, thereby cut- ting
  the fat, but in the end we agreed that the extra richness is worth the
  extra grams of fat. (By Times Food Stylists) Sift together flour, baking
  powder and salt into large bowl. Stir in oats and brown sugar. Beat egg
  whites lightly in another bowl. Stir in Raisin Puree. Stir into flour
  mixture along with chocolate, walnuts, and orange zest just until blended.

  Sweet potato puree provides the moistness in these individual non- fat
  cakes.  Mini-bundt pans, each containing 6-bundt shaped cups, are available

      Title: Anise Meringue Kisses
 Categories: Cookies
   Servings: 48
 
      3    Egg whites                        1/2 c  Sugar
    1/8 ts Cream of tartar                 1 1/2 ts Ground anise seeds
 
  The flavor of anise in these light cookies makes them a great after- dinner
  dessert. Some people prefer the center to be soft and chewy, but if you
  prefer the dry melt-in-your-mouth type of meringue, turn off the oven and,
  with the door closed, let them stand 30 minutes to an hour. These cookies
  are generally baked on parchment paper, but we have found that regular bond
  paper makes a very acceptable substitute. (By Times Food Stylists) Beat egg
  whites until frothy. Add cream of tartar and beat to soft peaks. Gradually
  beat in sugar. Continue beating until stiff and glossy. Beat in anise.
  Using pastry bag, pipe onto parchment-lined baking sheets. Bake at 275
  degrees F. 30 minutes. Makes about 4 dozen kisses. NOTE: If drier meringue
  is desired, turn off oven and let kisses stand in oven with door closed
  about 1 hour. Each kiss contains about: 9 calories; 4 mg sodium; 0
  cholesterol; 0 fat; 2 grams carbohydrates; 0 protein; trace fiber.

  2-2 1/2 tb very cold water The low-calorie rice pudding flan is so
  delicious by itself that you may want to save the calories and fat in the
  crust, and serve it without the pastry. Bring nonfat milk to boil in medium
  saucepan. Add vanilla bean and rice. Cover partially and simmer until rice
  is almost tender, about 20 to 30 minutes, stirring occasionally. Stir in
  sugar and continue and continue cooking 3 minutes. Remove from heat and
  cool slightly. Remove vanilla bean. Blend egg substitute with ricotta
  cheese. Stir into rice mixture with candied ginger. Carefully pour into
  prepared pastry shell, filling almost to the top (if there is any flan
  mixture left from incomplete reduction in cooking, place in small custard
  dish, cover and microwave 40 to 60 seconds or until set.) Sprinkle with 1/4
  teaspoon cinnamon. Bake at 400 degrees F. 25 to 30 minutes or until set.
  Remove from oven. Sift powdered sugar over and sprinkle with remaining
  cinnamon. Serve warm and garnish with sliced ginger if desired. Makes 12
  servings. Each serving contains about: 183 calories; 102 mg sodium; 11 mg
  cholesterol; 4 grams fat; 31 grams carbohydrates; 6 grams protein; 0.25

  In a roasting pan, roast the beef in the middle of a preheated 400f oven
  for 25-30 minutes or until a meat thermometer registers 120f. Let the
  fillet cool completely and discard the larding fat and strings. Skim the

  brushing the edges of the dough with some egg white to seal them. Fold the
  ends of the dough over the fillet and seal with the egg white. Transfer the
  fillet, seam side down, to a jelly-roll pan and brush the dough with egg
  wash.  Roll out additional dough and cut out shapes with which to decorate
  the dough. After applying, brush with egg wash. Chill for at least 1 hour
  and up to 2 hours. Bake the fillet in the middle of a preheated 400f oven
  for 30 minutes.
   Reduce heat to 350f and bake an additional 5-10 minutes more or until a
  meat thermometer registers 130f for medium rare meat and the pastry is
  cooked through.  Let stand for 15 minutes. In a saucepan, boil the reserved
  pan juices and the Madeira until the mixture is reduced by one fourth. Add
  the arrowroot mixture, broth, truffles, and salt and pepper to taste. Cook
  the sauce over moderate heat, stirring, for 5 minutes or until thickened,
  being careful not to let it boil. Loosen the fillet from the pan,
  transfering it to a heated platter. Garnish with watercress. Serve the

  rosemary, lemon, and celery.  Simmer the mixture for 20 minutes or until
  the liquid is reduced to about 3 Tbsp. Lay the salmon on a piece of heavy
  foil, twice as long as the fish. Pick up edges of foil and pour the wine
  mixture over the fish. Season with salt and fold the foil to enclose it,
  crimping the edges tightly to secure them. Put the salmon on a large baking
  sheet or roasting pan and bake it in the middle of a preheated 375f oven
  for 50-60 minutes or until the fish just flakes. Transfer the package to a
  work surface, open foil carefully, and remove the skin from the top of the
  salmon below the head to the bottom of the salmon at the tail. Scrape away
  any brown flesh, leaving head and tail intact. Drain liquid from the foil,
  and using the foil as a guide, invert the fish onto a platter. Remove foil
  and skin and prepare the other side of the salmon in the same manner. Chill
  the fish, covered, overnight. Peel turnip and cut into thin slices. Trim
  each slice to ressemble a flower or cut with a flower cutter. Place in a
  bowl of ice water to hold until ready for use. Mash the egg yolk with the
  butter and reserve at room temperature. Spoon a thin coat of cool but
  liquid fish aspic over the salmon and arrange the additional tarragon
  sprigs and turnip flowers decoratively on the fish. Spoon a thin coat of
  liquid aspic over the whole. Transfer the yolk mixture to a pastry bag
  fitted with a decorative tip. Pipe the mixture into the centers of the
  flowers. Chill the salmon for at least 2 hours or up to 6 hours. Serve

  boil, stirring occasionally, for 15 minutes.  In a food processor, puree
  the mixture and force it through a fine sieve into a large bowl, pressing
  hard on the solids.
  
  In a small saucepan, sprinkle gelatin over the lemon juice and schnapps,
  let it soften for 5 minutes, then heat mixture over low heat, stirring,
  until gelatin has dissolved.  Stir gelatin into nectarine puree, blending
  the mixture well.  Let it cool to room temperature.
  
  In a chilled bowl, beat the cream until it holds soft shapes, (not as stiff
  as soft peaks) and fold it into the nectarine mixture.
  
  Trim the Genoise and cut it into three layers, horizonally.
  
  Peach Syrup:    In a small saucepan, combine the sugar and 1/4 cup water.
  Bring to a boil, stirring until sugar is dissolved, and stir in the
  schnapps.  Let the syrup cool to room temperature. Assembly: Center one
  layer in the bottom of a 9-1/2-inch springform pan and brush with half the
  peach syrup.  Pour half the mousse over the cake and top it with another
  layer of Genoise.  Brush with the remaining peach syrup and pour the
  remaining mousse over the cake, rapping on the side of the pan to expel any
  air bubbles and smoothing the surface. Chill for 2 hours, or until it is
  set.
  
  Peach Glaze:    In a small bowl, sprinkle gelatin over 3 Tbsp cold water
  and let it soften for 5 minutes.  In a small saucepan, combine the
  preserves and schnapps, bring mixture to a boil, stirring, and simmer it
  for 1 minute.  Remove pan from heat, add gelatin mixture, stirring until
  gelatin is dissolved, and strain the mixture through a fine sieve into a
  bowl, pressing hard on the solids.
  
  Assembly:      Pour all but about 2 Tbsp of Peach Glaze over top of the
  mousse cake, covering it completely, and chill the cake for 2 hours, or
  until glaze is set.
  
  While cake is chilling, in a food processor, grind the remaining Genoise
  layer into fine crumbs.  Toast the crumbs in a jelly-roll pan in a
  preheated 350f oven for 5-8 minutes or until they are golden. Reserve.
  
  Cut half the nectarine into thin slices, and arrange them decoratively on
  top of the cake in a pinwheel pattern.  Brush the remaining glaze over the
  nectarine slices and chill the cake, covered, for 1 hour, or until the
  newly applied glaze is set.
  
  Run a thin knife around the edge of the pan and remove the side of the pan.
  Working over a sheet of wax paper, coat sides of cake with the cake crumbs.
  
  Let cake stand at room temperature for 20 minutes before serving.

      2 tb Flour                          
 
  In a kettle, combine the chicken with enough salted water to cover it by 2
  inches.  Bring water to a boil, and simmer the chicken for 20 minutes or

  strain through a fine sieve, discarding the solids. Skim off fat. Boil the
  stock until it is reduced to about 2 cups.
  
  Meanwhile, in a large saucepan, cook the mushrooms in 2 Tbsp butter over
  mod-low heat, stirring, until they are softened.  In a kettle of boiling
  salted water, cook spaghetti until it is al dente.  Drain it well. In a
  saucepan melt remaining butter over mod-low heat.  Add flour and cook the
  roux, stirring, for 3 minutes. Whisk in the reserved broth, cream and
  Sherry.  Bring the sauce to a boil, whisking, and simmer it for 5 minutes.
  Season with nutmeg and salt and pepper to taste.
  
  Stir half into the mushrooms with the spaghetti and transfer it to a
  well-buttered 2-1/2-qt. baking dish, making a well in the center. Add the
  chicken meat to the remaining sauce, combine well.  Spoon this into the
  center of the spaghetti and sprinkle with Parmesan cheese. Bake in the

  slices, slightly less than 1/8-inch thick.  Pat dry on paper towels.
  
  Half fill 2 large saucepans with oil.  Heat the first to 350f on a deep fat
  thermometer.  Heat the second pan of oil to 400f.
  
  Drop several potato slices into the first pan.  Remove from heat and shake
  to keep potatoes from sticking together.  When the oil temperature drops to
  300f, remove the potatoes with a skimmer and plunge them into the second
  pan. (The potatoes will puff and bob around on top of the oil.) Turn the
  puffs constantly until well browned on all sides. Transfer the potatoes to
  paper towels to drain.
  
  Bring both pans of oil back to specified temperatures, then repeat until
  all potatoes are cooked.
  
  Sprinkle with salt and keep warm until ready to serve.

  NOTE:     Be VERRRRY careful as there is a considerable tendency to spatter
  oil, doing this. BURNS to the cook or kitchen FIRES are a very REAL DANGER
  in this recipe.

      2 ts Baking powder                  
 
  Carefully remove the shells from the shrimp, leaving the tail sections
  intact. Devein and wash under cold running water; pat dry with paper
  towels.  In a dish or bowl, marinate briefly in a mixture of the vodka,
  salt, and pepper while you make the batter.
  
  In a mixing, put the flour and baking powder; gradually add the cold water,
  whisking until smooth.
  
  In a wok, heat the 2 cup of oil until it reaches 350 degrees F.  Add 1
  tablespoon of the hot oil to the batter and stir to combine.  Take a shrimp
  by the tail and dip it into the batter (do not dip the tail), then slide it

  brown. This should take about 2 minutes for each batch. Drain on paper
  towels, and serve tails up, in a serving dish, with the salt/pepper mixture
  for dipping. Makes 8 to 10 appetizer servings.
  
  FOR DIPPING:  In a bowl, combine coarse salt and the peppercorns.  In a dry
  frying pan over high heat, brown the salt/pepper mixture.  When browned
  remove and run the mixture through a grinder.

      1 pk Active dry yeast                    2 tb Honey
      1 tb Kosher (or regular) salt            1    Egg white lightly beaten
  1 1/2 c  Warm water (110 to 115         
 
  In the bowl of an electric mixer, combine 1 cup of the flour, the yeast and
  salt.  Add the water and honey and beat until smooth. Add the remaining
  flour,1 cup at a time, to make a soft dough. Turn the dough out onto a
  generously floured board and continue working on the flour until the dough
  is stiff enough to knead. Knead until smooth and elastic, 5 to 10 minutes.
  Cover with a towel and let rise 15 minutes. Divide the dough into 8 to 12
  equal portions.  Shape each portion into a flattened ball. With your
  forefinger, poke a hole in the center. Stretch and rotate the dough until
  the hole is 1 1/2 to 2 inches wide. Place the bagels on a well-floured
  board, cover with another towel, and let them rise for 20 minutes. Preheat
  oven to 375 degrees. Fill a large shallow pan (a wok works well) with 3
  inches of water. Bring the water to a boil, reduce the heat and simmer. Add
  a few bagels at a time and simmer for 5 minutes (turning once or twice).
  Remove the bagels from the pan with a slotted spoon and drain on a towel.
  Place the bagels on well-oiled baking sheets, brush with egg white and
  sprinkle with topping of your choice. Bake for 30 minutes, until well
  browned.  Transfer to racks to cool. SUGGESTED TOPPINGS: Kosher salt,
  finely chopped onions or garlic, poppy, sesame or caraway seeds.

   Servings:  6
 
      2    Whole chicken beasts,               3    Slices fresh ginger, minced
           Skinned and boned                   1    Scallion (white part only),
      2 tb Szechuan peppercorns                     Chopped
      4 tb Sesame paste                        1 cl Garlic, minced fine
      3 tb Green tea                       1 1/2 tb Dry sherry or
      2 tb Wine vinegar                             Shaoshing wine
  2 1/2 ts Soy sauce                         1/2 ts Cayenne pepper
      3 tb Peanut oil                               Lettuce leaves
      2 ts Crushed red pepper *           
 
  *  or you substitute 2 whole chili peppers, crushed. In a pot, poach the
  chicken breasts in a little boiling water for 10 minutes until white and
  opaque. In a dry frying pan, toast the Szechuan peppercorns over moderate
  heat, then crust or grind them; set aside. Remove the chicken breasts from
  the pot, drain and cool them.  Slice them, then shred the slices into
  julienne pieces. In a mixing bowl, combine the sesame paste and green tea
  (or the peanut butter and sesame oil -- See NOTE). Add the vinegar and soy
  sauce; blend well. Add the peanut oil, red pepper, ginger, scallion,
  garlic, sherry, cayenne pepper, and the peppercorns. Mix all ingredients
  very well. Toss the chicken strips in this sauce, to coat. Refrigerate
  until 20 minutes before serving. Pass the chicken and the lettuce leaves
  separately, and let each guest place a small portion of the chicken in the
  middle of a lettuce leaf and roll it up like an egg roll to eat using
  fingers.  Makes 6 appetizer servings.
  
  NOTE:  The authentic recipe calls for green tea to thin the sesame seed
  paste,
       but you may substitute chicken broth, or simply water, if you prefer.
       Another substitution you may make if you wish is peanut butter for the
       sesame seed paste along with sesame oil instead of green tea.
       This dish is served cold or at room temperature and can be made a day
       ahead . -- Verdi

      2 tb Wine vinegar                          pn (tiny) 5-spice powder
      2 tb Dry sherry or                            (optional)
           Shaoshing wine                
-------------------------------DIPPING SAUCE-------------------------------
           Plum sauce                               Scallion, chopped
 
  Preheat the oven 10 375 degree F. Trim any excess fat from the ribs and
  place them in a long shallow dish. In a mixing bowl, combine the marinade
  ingredients; if you are using 5-spice powder, add it to the mixture by
  putting it through a tea strainer so it spreads out over the mixture. Mix
  well, and pour over the ribs and leave for 3 hours at room temperature or
  about 6 hours in the refrigerator.  Baste the ribs every hours or so,
  turning them over. TO ROAST THE RIBS: Remove the ribs from the marinade.
  Add the 1/4 cup plum sauce to the marinade; reserve it for basting. Hook
  metal drapery hooks through both ends of each rack of ribs, at the top, and
  hang each one as if you were hanging a hammock, suspended from the bars of
  one of the oven racks.  Set the oven rack in the highest position in the
  oven. On the floor of the oven or on another oven rack set at the lowest
  position in the oven, place a baking pan half filled with water, to collect
  drippings and prevent smoking. You may want to line the baking pan with
  aluminum foil before putting the water in, to make it easier to clean.
  Roast the spareribs for 45 minutes in the preheated oven.  Then baste them
  with the reserved basting sauce, using a small pastery brush and carefully
  pulling out the oven rack to facilitate the basting process. Turn the oven
  up to 450 degrees F and roast for another 15 minutes.  By this time the
  spareribs should be a rich golden brown with crisp edges.  Baste again,
  then take them out of the oven.  Place the ribs on a cutting board and
  remove the drapery hooks.  Separate the individual ribs with a cleaver or
  sharp knife.  Serve at room temperature, with dipping sauce.  Makes 6 to 8
  appetizer servings. NOTE: You will need about 12 drapery hooks. Recipe:
